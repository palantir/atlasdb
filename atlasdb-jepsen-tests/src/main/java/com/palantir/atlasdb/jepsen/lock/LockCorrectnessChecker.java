/**
 * Checker verifying that whenever a lock is granted, there was a time point between the request and the
 * acknowledge when the lock was actually free to be granted. This is tricky due to the existence of refreshes
 * and the uncertainty of the exact times because of the latency between requests and replies.
 *
 * A successful refresh means the lock was continuously held in the (open) interval
 * (a, b), where
 * a is the OkEvent.time() of the last successful lock,
 * b is the InvokeEvent.time() of the refresh,
 * <i>assuming</i> a successful refresh guarantees holding the lock since the last time the lock was granted. This will
 * be verified by another checker.
 *
 * A successful unlock can be treated the same as a refresh, except that it has implications for further refreshes
 * and unlocks (that we will check by other checkers).
 *
 * A successful lock means the lock was held <i>at some point</i> in the (closed) interval
 * [a, b], where
 * a is the InvokeEvent.time() of the lock request, and
 * b is its OkEvent.time()
 *
 * We mantain a map locksHeld mapping each lock name to the set of all intervals where we know the lock was granted to
 * a process, and a separate list map locksAtSomePoint tracking all intervals during which the lock was granted at some
 * point. Note that in the latter list, we purposefully do not merge intervals, to ensure no loss of information.
 *
 * To verify locks were correctly granted, it is necessary (though not sufficient -- we just don't have enough
 * information) to verify that, for each lockName, none of the uncertain intervals in locksAtSomePoint.get(lockName)
 * are fully covered by the intervals in the set of lock intervals locksHeld.get(lockName).

    /* Given the batch size in cells supplied by the user, we want to figure out the optimal (or at least decent)
     * batching parameters for Cassandra. The `get_range_slices' call allows us to load a "rectangle"
     * of cells at once:
     *
     *         |<-w=4->|
     *         ._______.      ___
     *   Row 1 |x x x x|       ^       (each 'x' is a (cell, ts) pair, i.e. a single "column" in Cassandra)
     *   Row 2 |x x    |       |
     *   Row 3 |x x x  |      h=5
     *   Row 4 |x x x x|x x    |
     *   Row 5 |x______|      _v_
     *   Row 6  x x
     *   Row 7  x x x x
     *   Row 8  x x x x x
     *        ...
     *   Row N  x x
     *
     * Here, the height of the rectangle "h" is KeyRange.count and the width "w" is SliceRange.count.
     * We want the area of our rectangle to be on the order of "cellBatchHint" supplied by the user, i.e.
     *
     *     w * h ~ cellBatchHint                  (1)
     *
     * The question is how to choose "w" and "h" appropriately. If a row contains "w" or more columns (like rows 1 and
     * 4 in the picture above), we need to make at least one extra round trip to retrieve that row individually
     * using the "get_slice" call. Thus, setting "w" too low will result in extra round trips to retrieve the individual
     * rows, while setting it too high would make "h" low (since "w" and "h" are inversely proportional as in (1)),
     * resulting in more round trips to make progress "vertically".
     *
     * It makes sense to try to minimize the number of round trips to Cassandra. Let's assume that rows will be short
     * enough to fit in "cellBatchHint", i.e. whenever we need to fetch the remainder of a row, we can do so with
     * a single call to "get_slice" with SliceRange.count set to "cellBatchHint". (If the assumption doesn't hold
     * and our rows are wide, then a particular choice of "w" and "h" doesn't have as much impact on the number of round
     * trips -- we need to page through the individual rows anyway).
     *
     * Then for a table with N rows, the number of round trips is approximately equal to
     *
     *     (N / h) + (# of rows with >= w columns)
     *
     * Let F(k) be the cumulative distribution function of the number of columns per row. Also, remember from (1)
     * that "h" is on the order of "cellBatchHint / w". Hence the above expression is approximately equal to
     *
     *     N * w / cellBatchHint + N * (1 - F(w - 1))
     *
     * Minimizing this is equivalent to minimizing
     *
     *     w / cellBatchHint - F(w - 1)            (2)
     *
     * So if we had an adequate model of F, we could estimate its parameters and minimize (2) with respect to "w".
     * The problem is that the nature of F can depend on the format of a particular table. For example, an append-only
     * table with five named columns where all five columns are always written at once for every row, will have
     * a degenerate distribution localized at 5; a single-column table with mutations might exhibit a Poisson-like
     * behavior; while a table with dynamic columns can be shaped according to an arbitrary distribution depending
     * on the user data.
     *
     * One other possibility is to compute a discrete approximation to the PDF/CDF instead of choosing a fixed family
     * of distributions and estimating its parameters, but that seems both excessive and expensive.
     *
     * Pragmatically speaking, we want a formula like
     *
     *     w = < estimated mean # columns per row > + 1 + g(sigma, cellBatchHint)    (3)
     *
     * where g(sigma, cellBatchHint) is some term that grows with variance sigma^2. The term is necessary to efficiently
     * handle both the "append-only fixed-column table" (zero variance) and the "partially dirty table" (high variance)
     * cases.
     *
     * If we minimize (2) in the case of F being the normal distribution, we get (after doing all the calculus):
     *
     *     w = mu + 1 + sigma * sqrt(-2 * ln(sqrt(2*pi*sigma^2) / cellBatchHint))       (4)
     *
     * where "mu" is the mean and "sigma" is the standard deviation. This actually looks like (3) for sufficiently
     * small values of sigma, with
     *
     *    g(sigma, cellBatchHint) = sigma * sqrt(-2 * ln(sqrt(2*pi*sigma^2) / cellBatchHint))     (5)
     *
     * Of course, a real table can't have normally distributed row widths (simply because the
     * row width is a discrete quantity), but:
     *
     *      - the normal distribution approximates the "clean narrow table" (low variance) case quite well,
     *        and is a half-decent approximation to the Poisson distribution (the "single-column dirty" case);
     *      - it's easy to estimate the parameters for it (mu and sigma), as well as to do the calculus exercise
     *        to get (4);
     *      - the numbers it produces actually seem reasonable.
     *
     * To illustrate the last point, here is a table of g(sigma, cellBatchHint) for some values of sigma. (The physical
     * meaning of "g" is the number of extra columns to fetch per row in addition to the mean number of columns per row)
     *
     *      cellBatchHint = 1000            cellBatchHint = 100
     *
     *       sigma  | g(sigma, 1000)         sigma  | g(sigma, 100)
     *      --------+---------------        --------+--------------
     *       0      |   0.00                 0      |  0.00
     *       0.5    |   1.82                 0.5    |  1.48
     *       1      |   3.46                 1      |  2.72

 * Transforms a {@code Supplier} by an output function, possibly to a different type. This {@code Supplier} caches

 * of the input does not change excessively frequently, and where the computation of the output function is expensive.
 *
 * See also {@link CachedComposedSupplier}. However, that differs in that that {@code Supplier} implements periodic
 * cache invalidation, and also supports explicit versioning (in particular, for use cases where {@code equals()}
 * comparison on the input objects is also expensive).

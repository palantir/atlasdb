/**
 * This interface exists because many cache calls don't make sense in a distributed sense.
 * For example, invalidating a cache element is not guaranteed to work,  if you depend on this
 * behavior for correctness, then it will be an error.  The only thing valid to store in a distributed
 * cache are immutable elements, because it is not guaranteed the cache will get updates as you propagate them.
 *
 * Caches may clear out elements at will, you may not rely on the cache containing an element.  You also may not
 * rely on the absence of an object.  Another server may put this object there.  You also may no rely on the newer
 * version being in the cache.
 *
 * This interface is here to be very strict with you so you don't "do the wrong thing" when it comes to
 * distributed caching.
 *
 * There are more complicated caching models with consistent caches where you push invalidates to all clients,
 * and they either all respond, or you have to wait the whole client timeout before you may do the write.

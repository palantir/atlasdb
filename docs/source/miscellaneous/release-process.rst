Release Process
===============

Release Schedule
================

We aim to release once a week, but may release faster to patch bugs or
slower if there is low code churn. We are still setting up a formal
branching model, but for now the ``develop`` branch serves as
``develop`` and ``release`` (we have no ``release`` branch) and we merge
releases into ``master``. This should change soon.

Cutting for Release
===================

1. Checkout the commit to tag for release (probably
   ``git checkout origin/develop``).
2. Tag the commit: ``git tag -a <version>``.
3. Push the tag to Github:
   ``git push origin <version>:refs/tags/<version>``.
4. After a short wait you can publish the artifacts on Bintray by going
   to the `AtlasDB
   page <https://bintray.com/palantir/releases/atlasdb/view>`__.

   .. note::
      You must have admin privledges on Bintray for this to work.
      
5. Edit the release notes that will appear for editing on AtlasDB GitHub `releae
   page <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/releases>`__.

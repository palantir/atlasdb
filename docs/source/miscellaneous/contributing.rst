Contributing to AtlasDB
=======================

Contributing Code
=================

Follow the steps provided in :ref:`running-from-source`.
We are happy to accept pull requests and could use help
implementing the AtlasDB API for more underlying physical stores.

In order to ensure your pull request is merged please keep the following in mind:

* Make sure checkstyle/findbugs pass. You can run this automatically at commit time by setting up a git hook using the script located at ``scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh``.
* Assign a member of the team for review, if it is incorrect it will be triaged to the correct person.
* Update the :ref:`change-log` with the change if it is public facing.
* If you are updating logic the expectation is that new tests will be added for the functionality, a lack of testing will likely delay the PR.

Contributing Docs
=================

The easiest way to contribute to docs is to edit them directly on GitHub using the link above:

1. On GitHub you will see the .rst file rendered and can edit it directly in your browser and preview the changes!
2. After making your edits you can submit a PR below the editor.  Please construct a simple commit message highlighting your changes and create a branch name preferably with the pattern ``docs/*``.

If you would like to build the docs locally follow these steps:

1. Clone the git repository:``git clone git@github.com:palantir/atlasdb.git; cd atlasdb``.
2. Install sphinx and sphinx_rtd_theme if you don't have it.  Instructions can be found `here <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stab/install.html>`__.  The easiest option for Mac users will be using pip.  Please be sure to update sphinx if you haven't used it in a while.  Also please be aware the exact commands to build the docs can be found in ``scripts/circle-ci/publish-github-pages.sh``.
3. Confirm you installation is working by running ``cd docs && make html``.  The freshly built documentation will be in ``docs/build/html``.
4. Existing pages can be found in ``docs/source``. Create new pages by adding an .rst file to ``docs/source`` and then adding the file name to the appropriate .toctree in the parent file.
5. Commit any changes to a ``docs/*`` branch and push them up to github for review.

You can generate and view the docs locally by running
``make html`` and opening the built html files in ``docs/build/html/`` in your browser of choice.

The docs are built using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`__ and written in `.rst <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__.

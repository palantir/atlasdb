    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |new|
         - Oracle SE will now automatically trigger shrinking table data post sweeping a table to recover space.
           You can disable the compaction by setting ``enableShrinkOnOracleStandardEdition`` to ``false`` in the Oracle DDL config.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2286>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Refactored ``AvailableTimestamps`` reducing overzealous synchronization. Giving out timestamps is no longer blocking on refreshing the timestamp bound if there are enough timestamps to give out with the current bound.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1783>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - The lock server now logs to ``SlowLockLogger`` logger if a request takes more than a given time (10 seconds by default) to be processed.
           Specifically, the timelock server has a configuration parameter ``slowLockLogTriggerMillis`` which defaults to ``10000``.
           Setting this parameter to zero (or any negative number) will disable the new logger; slow locks will instead be logged at ``DEBUG``.
           If not using timelock, an application can modify the trigger value through ``LockServerOptions`` during initialization in ``TransactionManagers.create``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1791>`__)

    *    - |deprecated|
         - Deprecated ``InMemoryAtlasDbFactory#createInMemoryTransactionManager``, please instead use the supported ``TransactionManagers.createInMemory(...)`` for your testing.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1784>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - AtlasDB HTTP clients now parse ``Retry-After`` headers correctly.
           This manifests as clients failing over and trying other nodes when receiving a 503 with a ``Retry-After`` header from a remote (e.g. from a TimeLock non-leader).
           Previously, clients would immediately retry the connection on the node with a 503 two times (for a total of three attempts) before failing over.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1782>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Improved performance of getRange() on DbKvs. Range requests are now done with a single round trip to the database.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1805>`__)
    
    *    - |improved|
         - The lock server now will dump all held locks and outstanding lock requests in YAML file, when logging state requested, for easy readability and further processing.
           This will make debuging lock congestions easier. Lock descriptors are changed with places holders and can be decoded using descriptors file,
           which will be written in the folder. Information like requesting clients, requesting threads and other details can be found in the YAML.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1792>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - The ``atlasdb-config`` project now shadows the ``error-handling`` and ``jackson-support`` libraries from `http-remoting <https://github.com/palantir/http-remoting>`__.
           This will be used to handle exceptions in a future release, and was done in this way to avoid causing dependency issues in upstream products.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1796>`__)

    *    - |userbreak|
         - AtlasDB will refuse to start if backed by Postgres 9.5.0 or 9.5.1. These versions contain a known bug that causes incorrect results to be returned for certain queries.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1820>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Atlas Console tables now have a join() method.  See ``help("join")`` in Atlas Console for more details.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1814>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Added logging for leadership election code,
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3294>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - The sweep CLI will no longer perform in-process compactions after sweeping a table.
           For DbKvs, this operation is handled by the background compaction thread; Cassandra performs its own compactions.
           Note that the sweep CLI itself has been deprecated in favour of using the sweep priority override configuration, possibly in conjunction with the thread count (:ref:`Docs<sweep_tunable_parameters>`).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3369>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fix ``SnapshotTransaction#getRows`` to apply ``ColumnSelection`` when there are local writes.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3008>`__)

    :header-rows: 1

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |improved|
         - The default ``sweepBatchSize`` has been changed from 1000 to 100.
           This has empirically shown to be a better batch size because it puts less stress on the underlying KVS.
           For a full list of tunable sweep parameters and default settings, see :ref:`sweep tunable options <sweep_tunable_parameters>`.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1763>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Reverted `#1524 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1524>`__, which caused dependency issues in upstream products.
           Once we have resolved these issues, we will reintroduce the change, which was originally part of AtlasDB 0.37.0.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1775>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Creating a postgres table with a long name now throws a ``RuntimeException`` if the truncated name (first sixty characters) is the same as that of a different existing table.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1729>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed a performance regression introduced in `#582 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/582>`__, which caused sub-optimal batching behaviour when getting large sets of rows in Cassandra.
           The benchmark, intentionally set up in `#1770 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1770>`__ to highlight the break, shows a 10x performance improvement.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1764>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Correctness issue fixed in the ``clean-transactions-range`` CLI. This CLI is responsible for deleting potentially inconsistent transactions in the KVS upon restore from backup.
           The CLI was not reading the entire ``_transactions`` table, and as a result missed deleting transactions that started before and committed after.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1759>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - The ``atlasdb-remoting`` project was removed. We don't believe this was used anywhere, but if you encounter any problems due to the project having being removed, please contact AtlasDB support.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1750>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - ``InMemoryAtlasDbFactory`` now supports creating an in-memory transaction manager with multiple schemas.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1774>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Timelock users who start an embedded timestamp and lock service without :ref:`reverse-migrating <timelock-reverse-migration>` now encounter a more informative error message.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1755>`__)

v0.37.0

Removed 6 Apr 2017 due to dependency issues. Please use 0.38.0 instead.

Released 29 Mar 2017

    :widths: 5 40
    :header-rows: 1

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed an issue where a ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesError`` would not be propagated from the asynchronous refresh job that increases the timestamp bound.
           This could result in a state where two timestamp services are simultaneously handing out timestamps until the older service's buffer of 1M timestamps is exhausted and fails.
           Now we immediately fail, alerting users much sooner that a ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesError`` has occurred.
           Note that users would still see the error prior to the fix, we now just ensure it is discovered sooner.
           This failure does not affect the Timelock server.
           Furthermore, we improved the logic for increasing the timestamp bound when the allocation buffer is exhausted.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1718>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added :ref:`Dropwizard metrics <dropwizard-metrics>` for sweep, exposing aggregate and table-specific counts of cells examined and stale values deleted.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1695>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added a benchmark ``TimestampServiceBenchmarks`` for parallel requesting of fresh timestamps from the TimestampService.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1720>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - KVS migrations now maintain the guarantee of the timestamp service to hand out monotonically increasing timestamps.
           Previously, we would reset the timestamp service to 0 after a migration, but now we use the correct logical timestamp.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1199>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Improved performance of paging over dynamic columns on Oracle DBKVS: the time required to page through a large wide row is now linear rather than quadratic in the length of the row.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1702>`__)

    *    - |deprecated|
         - ``GenericStreamStore.loadStream`` has been deprecated.
           Use ``loadSingleStream``, which returns an ``Optional<InputStream>``, instead.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1265>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - ``getAsyncRows`` and ``getAsyncRowsMultimap`` methods have been removed from generated code.
           They do not appear valuable to the API and use an unintuitive and custom ``AsyncProxy`` that was also removed.
           We believe they are unused by upstream applications, but if you do encounter breaks due to this removal please file a ticket with the dev team for immediate support.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1689>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - RemoteLockService clients will no longer silently retry on connection failures to the Timelock server.
           This is used to mitigate issues with frequent leadership changes owing to `#1680 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1680>`__.
           Previously, because of Jetty's idle timeout and OkHttp's silent connection retrying, we would generate an endless stream of lock requests if using HTTP/2 and blocking for more than the Jetty idle timeout for a single lock.
           This would lead to starvation of other requests on the TimeLock server, since a lock request blocked on acquiring a lock consumes a server thread.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1727>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Cassandra dependencies have been bumped to newer versions.
           This should fix a bug (`#1654 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1654>`__) that caused
           AtlasDB probing downed Cassandra nodes every few minutes to see if they were up and working yet to eventually take out the entire cluster by steadily
           building up leaked connections, due to a bug in the underlying driver.

15 Mar 2017

    :header-rows: 1

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed DBKVS sweep OOM issue (`#982 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/982>`__) caused by very wide rows.
           ``DbKvs.getRangeOfTimestamps`` uses an adjustable cell batch size to avoid loading too many timestamps.
           One can set the batch size by calling ``DbKvs.setMaxRangeOfTimestampsBatchSize``.

           In case of a single row that is too wide, this may result in ``getRangeOfTimestamps`` returning multiple ``RowResult`` to include all timestamps.
           It is, however, guaranteed that each ``RowResult`` will contain all timestamps for each included column.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1678>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Actions run by the ``ReadOnlyTransactionManager`` can no longer bypass necessary protections when using ``getRowsColumnRange()``.
           These protections disallow reads against ``THOROUGH`` swept tables as read only transactions do not acquire the appropriate locks to guarantee transactionality.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1521>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed an unnecessarily long-held connection in Oracle table name mapping code.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1593>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed an issue where we excessively log after successful transactions.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1687>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed an issue where the ``_persisted_locks`` table was unnecessarily logged as not having persisted metadata.
           The ``_persisted_locks`` table is a hidden table, and thus it does not need to have persisted metadata.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1696>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - AtlasDB now instruments services to expose aggregate response time and service call metrics for keyvalue, timestamp, and lock services.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1685>`__)

    *    - |devbreak| |improved|
         - ``TransactionManager`` now explicitly declares a ``close`` method that does not throw exceptions.
           This makes the ``TransactionManager`` significantly easier to develop against.
           Clients who have implemented a concrete ``TransactionManager`` throwing checked exceptions are encouraged to wrap said exceptions as unchecked exceptions.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1677>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added the following benchmarks for paging over columns of a very wide row:

             - ``TransactionGetRowsColumnRangeBenchmarks``
             - ``KvsGetRowsColumnRangeBenchmarks``

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1684>`__)

    *    - |deprecated|
         - The public ``PaxosLeaderElectionService`` constructor is now deprecated to mitigate risks of users supplying parameters in the wrong order.
           ``PaxosLeaderElectionServiceBuilder`` should be used instead.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1681>`__)

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |improved|
         - Timelock server now specifies minimum and maximum heap size of 512 MB.
           This should improve GC performance per the comments in `#1594 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1594#discussion_r102255336>`__.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1647>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - The background sweeper now uses deleteRange instead of truncate when clearing the ``sweep.progress`` table.
           This allows users with Postgres to perform backups via the normal pg_dump command while running background sweep.
           Previous it was possible for a backup to fail if sweep were performing a truncate at the same time.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1616>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Cassandra now attempts to truncate when performing a ``deleteRange(RangeRequest.All())`` in an effort to build up less garbage.
           This is relevant for when sweep is operating on its own sweep tables.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1617>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Users can now create a Docker image and run containers of the Timelock Server, by running ``./gradlew timelock-server:dockerTag``.
           This can be useful for quickly spinning up a Timelock instance (e.g. for testing purposes).
           Note that we are not yet publishing this image.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1661>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - AtlasDB :ref:`CLIs <clis>` run via the :ref:`Dropwizard bundle <dropwizard-bundle>` can now work with a Timelock block, and will contact the relevant Timelock server for timestamps or locks in this case.
           Previously, these CLIs would throw an error that a leader block was not specified.
           Note that CLIs will not perform automated migrations.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1661>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Cassandra truncates that are going to fail will do so faster.

    *    - |devbreak|
         - The persistent lock endpoints now use ``PersistentLockId`` instead of ``LockEntry``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1665>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - The ``CheckAndSetException`` now gets mapped to the correct response for compatibility with `http-remoting <https://github.com/palantir/http-remoting>`__.
           Previously, any consumer using http-remoting would have to deal with deserialization errors.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1665>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - The persistent lock release endpoint has now been renamed to ``releaseBackupLock`` since it is currently only supposed to be used for the backup lock.

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |new|
         - Timelock server now supports `HTTP/2 <https://http2.github.io/>`__, and the AtlasDB HTTP clients enable a required GCM cipher suite.
           This feature improves performance of the Timelock server.
           Any client that wishes to connect to the timelock server via HTTP/2 must add jetty_alpn_agent as a javaAgent JVM argument, otherwise connections will fall back to HTTP/1.1 and performance will be considerably slower.

           For an example of how to add this dependency, see our `timelock-server/build.gradle <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1594/files#diff-e7db4468f37a8004be3c399d791c323eR57>`__ file.

         - AtlasDB :ref:`Perf CLI <perf-cli>` can now output KVS-agnostic benchmark data (such as ``HttpBenchmarks``) to a file.
           Previously running these benchmarks whilst attempting to write output to a file would fail.

    *    - |fixed|
         - AtlasDB HTTP clients are now compatible with OkHttp 3.3.0+, and no longer assume that header names are specified in Train-Case.
           This fix enables the Timelock server and AtlasDB clients to use HTTP/2.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1613>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Canonicalised SQL strings will now have contiguous whitespace rendered as a single space as opposed to the first character of said whitespace.
           This is important for backwards compatibility with an internal product.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1603>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added the option to perform a dry run of sweep via the :ref:`Sweep CLI <atlasdb-sweep-cli>`.
           When ``--dry-run`` is set, sweep will tell you how many cells would have been deleted, but will not actually delete any cells.

           This feature was introduced to avoid accidentally generating more tombstones than the Cassandra tombstone threshold (default 100k) introduced in `CASSANDRA-6117 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6117>`__.
           If you delete more than 100k cells and thus cross the Cassandra threshold, then Cassandra may reject read requests until the tombstones have been compacted away.
           Customers wishing to run Sweep should first run with the ``--dry-run`` option and only continue if the number of cells to be deleted is fewer than 100k.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1598>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed atlasdb-commons Java 1.6 compatibility by removing tracing from ``InterruptibleProxy``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1599>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Persisted locks table is now considered an Atomic Table.

           ``ATOMIC_TABLES`` are those that must always exist on KVSs that support check-and-set (CAS) operations.
           This is particularly relevant for AtlasDB clients that make use of the TableSplittingKVS and want to keep tables on different KVSs.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1610>`__)

         - Fixed erroneous occurrence of ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesError`` (see `#1000 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1000>`__) where the timestamp service was unaware of successfully writing the new timestamp limit to the DB.
           This fix only applies to Cassandra backed AtlasDB clients who are not using the external Timelock service.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1577>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - AtlasDB HTTP clients will now have a user agent of ``<project.name>-atlasdb (project.version)`` as opposed to ``okhttp/2.5.0``.
           This should make distinguishing AtlasDB request logs from application request logs much easier.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1535>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Sweep now takes out a lock to ensure data is not corrupted during online backups.

           Users performing :ref:`live backups <backup-restore>` should grab this lock before performing a backup of the underlying KVS, and then release the lock once the backup is complete.
           This enables the backup to safely run alongside either the :ref:`background sweeper <background-sweep>` or the :ref:`sweep CLI <atlasdb-sweep-cli>`.

         - Removed an unused hamcrest import from the timestamp-impl project.

         - Modified the type signature of ``BatchingVisitableView#of`` to no longer accept ``final BatchingVisitable<? extends T> underlyingVisitable`` and instead accept ``final BatchingVisitable<T> underlyingVisitable``.
           This will resolve an issue where newer versions of Intellij fail to compile AtlasDB.

    *    - |new|
         - Upon startup of an AtlasDB client with a ``timeblock`` :ref:`config block <timelock-client-configuration>`, the client will now automatically migrate its timestamp to the the :ref:`external Timelock cluster <external-timelock-service>`.

           The client will fast-forward the Timelock Server's timestamp bound to that of the embedded service.
           The client will now also *invalidate* the embedded service's bound, backing this up in a separate row in the timestamp table.

           Automated migration is only supported for Cassandra KVS at the moment.
           If using DBKVS or other key-value services, it remains the user's responsibility to ensure that they have performed the migration detailed in :ref:`Migration to External Timelock Services <timelock-migration>`.

         - Improved Oracle performance on DBKVS by preventing excessive reads from the _namespace table when initializing SweepStrategyManager.
           Replaced ``mapToFullTableNames()`` with ``generateMapToFullTableNames()`` in ``com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.TableMappingService``.

         - Removed the unused ``TieredKeyValueService`` which offered the ability to spread tables across multiple KVSs that exist in a stacked hierarchy (primary & secondary).
           If you require this KVS please file a ticket to have it reinstated.

    *    - |devbreak|
         - Fast forwarding a persistent timestamp service to ``Long.MIN_VALUE`` will now throw an exception, whereas previously it would be a no-op.
           Calling the ``fast-forward`` endpoint without specifying the fast-forward timestamp parameter will now default to submitting ``Long.MIN_VALUE``, and thus return a HTTP 400 response.

           We are introducing this break to prevent accidental corruption by forgetting to submit the fast-forward timestamp.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Oracle queries now use the correct hints when generating the query plan.
           This will improve performance for Oracle on DB KVS.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1549>`__)

    *    - |userbreak|
         - Oracle table names can now have a maximum length of 27 characters instead of the previous limit of 30.
           This is to ensure consistency in naming the primary key constraint which adds a prefix of ``pk_`` to the table name.
           This will break any installation of Oracle with the ``useTableMapping`` flag set to ``true``.

           Since Oracle support is still in beta, we are not providing an automatic migration path from older versions of AtlasDB.

           To use Java8 optionals, supply ``OptionalType.JAVA8`` as an additional constructor argument when creating your ``Schema`` object.

           Additionally, this fix requires all AtlasDB clients to regenerate their schema, even if they do not use the Java 8 optionals.

    *    - |new|
         - Added support for benchmarking custom Key Value Stores.

    *    - |improved|
         - Don't retry interrupted remote calls.

           This should have the effect of shutting down faster in situations where we receive a ``InterruptedException``.

         - More informative logging around retrying of transactions.
           If a transaction succeeds after being retried, we log the success (at the INFO level).
           If a transaction failed, but will be retried, we now also log the number of failures so far (at INFO).

    *    - |fixed|
         - Stream store compression, introduced in 0.27.0, no longer creates a transaction inside a transaction when streaming directly to a file.
           Additionally, a check was added to enforce the condition imposed in 0.28.0, namely that the caller of ``AbstractGenericStreamStore.loadStream`` should not call ``InputStream.read()`` within the transaction that was used to fetch the stream.

    *    - |new|
         - Added a new ``KeyValueService`` API method, ``checkAndSet``.
           This is to be used in upcoming backup lock changes, and is not intended for other usage. If you think your application would benefit from using this directly, please contact the AtlasDB dev team.
           This is supported for Cassandra, Postgres, and Oracle, but in the latter case support is only provided for tables which are not overflow tables.
           ``checkAndSet`` is **not** supported for RocksDB or JDBC.

         - Increase default Cassandra pool size from minimum of 20 and maximum of 5x the minimum (100 if minimum not modified) connections to minimum of 30 and maximum of 100 connections.
           This has empirically shown better handling of bursts of requests that would otherwise require creating many new connections to Cassandra from the clients.

    *    - |new|
         - Added metrics to SnapshotTransaction to monitor durations of various operations such as ``get``, ``getRows``, ``commit``, etc.
           AtlasDB users should use ``AtlasDbMetrics.setMetricRegistry`` to set a ``MetricRegistry``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1429>`__)

    *    - |new|

    *    - |new|
         - There is now a ``TimestampMigrationService`` with the ``fast-forward`` method that can be used to migrate between timestamp services.
           You will simply need to fast-forward the new timestamp service using the latest timestamp from the old service.
           This can be done using the :ref:`timestamp forward cli <offline-clis>` when your AtlasDB services are offline.

           This capability was added so we can automate the migration to an external Timelock service in a future release.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fix an issue with stream store where pre-loading the first block of an input stream caused us to create a transaction inside another transaction.
           To avoid this issue, it is now the caller's responsibility to ensure that ``InputStream.read()`` is not called within the transaction used to fetch the stream.

    *    - |fixed|
         - All SnapshotTransaction ``get`` methods are now safe for tables declared with SweepStrategy.THOROUGH.
           Previously, a validation check was omitted for ``getRowsColumnRange``, ``getRowsIgnoringLocalWrites``, and ``getIgnoringLocalWrites``, which in very rare cases could have resulted in deleted values being returned by a long-running read transaction.

    *    - |userbreak|
         - Users must not create a client named ``leader``. AtlasDB Timelock Server will fail to start if this is found.
           Previously, using ``leader`` would have silently failed, since the JAXRS 3.7.2 algorithm does not include backtracking over
           root resource classes (so either leader election or timestamp requests would have failed).

         - AtlasDB now supports stream store compression.
           Streams can be compressed client-side by adding the ``compressStreamInClient`` option to the stream definition.
           Reads from the stream store will transparently decompress the data.

           For information on using the stream store, see :ref:`schemas-streams`.

    *    - |improved|
         - ``StreamStore.loadStream`` now actually streams data if it does not fit in memory.
           This means that getting the first byte of the stream now has constant-time performance, rather than
           linear in terms of stream length as it was previously.

         - Increased Cassandra connection pool idle timeout to 10 minutes, and reduced eviction check frequency to 20-30 seconds at 1/10 of connections.

    *    - |new|
         - There is a new configuration called ``maxConnectionBurstSize``, which configures how large the pool is able to grow when receiving a large burst of requests.
           Previously this was hard-coded to 5x the ``poolSize`` (which is now the default for the parameter).

         - Oracle value style caching limited in scope to per-KVS, previously per-JVM, which could have in extremely rare cases caused issues for users in non-standard configurations.

         - Substantially improved performance of the DBKVS implementation of the single-iterator version of getRowsColumnRange.
           Two new performance benchmarks were added as part of this PR:

              - ``KvsGetRowsColumnRangeBenchmarks.getAllColumnsAligned``
              - ``KvsGetRowsColumnRangeBenchmarks.getAllColumnsUnaligned``

           These benchmarks show a 2x improvement on Postgres, and an AtlasDB client has observed an order of magnitude improvement experimentally.

         - All Oracle table names will be truncated and be of the form: ``<prefix>_<2-letter-namespace>__<table-name>_<5-digit-int>``.
           Previously we only truncated names that exceeded the character limit for Oracle table names.
           This should improve legibility as all table names for a particular application will have identical formatting.

           Oracle is in beta, and thus we have not built a migration path from old table names to new table names.

         - If using the Dropwizard command to run a KVS migration, the Dropwizard config will be used as the ``--migrateConfig`` config if none is specified.
           Running the KVS migration command as a deployable CLI still requires ``--migrateConfig``.

    *    - |deprecated|
         - ``TableReference.createUnsafe`` is now deprecated to prevent mishandling of table names.
           ``createWithEmptyNamespace`` or ``createFromFullyQualifiedName`` should be used instead.

           Schema generated code still contains use of ``TableReference.createUnsafe`` and is being tracked for removal on `#1172 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1172>`__.

    *    - |improved|
         - Added a significant amount of logging aimed at tracking down the ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesError``.
           If clients are hitting this error, then they should add TRACE logging for ``com.palantir.timestamp``.

         - Fixed an issue where some locks were not being tracked for continuous refreshing due to one of the lock methods not being overridden by the ``LockRefreshingLockService``.
           This resulted in locks that appeared to be refreshed properly, but then would mysteriously time out at the end of a long-running operation.

         - Fixed a regression with Cassandra KVS where you could no longer create a table if it has the same name as another table in a different namespace.

           To illustrate the issue, assume you have namespace ``namespace1`` and the table ``table1``, and you would like to add a column to ``table1`` and `version` the table by using the new namespace ``namespace2``.
           On disk you already have the Cassandra table ``namespace1__table1``, and now you are trying to create ``namespace2__table1``.
           Creating ``namespace2__table1`` would fail because Cassandra KVS believes that the table already exists.
           This is relevant if you use multiple namespaces when performing schema migrations.

           Note that namespace is an application level abstraction defined as part of a AtlasDB schema and is not the same as Cassandra keyspace.

         - Hotspotting warnings, previously logged at ERROR, will now throw ``IllegalStateException`` when generating your schema code.
           Products who hit this warning will need to add ``ignoreHotspottingChecks()`` to the relevant tables of their schema, or modify their schemas such that the first row component is not a VAR_STRING, a VAR_LONG, a VAR_SIGNED_LONG, or a SIZED_BLOB.

    *    - |new|
         - Oracle is supported via DBKVS if you have runtime dependency on an Oracle driver that resolves the JsonType "jdbcHandler".
           Due to an Oracle limitation, all table names in the schema must be less than 30 characters long.

         - The DBKVS config now enforces that the namespace must always be empty for ``metadataTable`` in the ``ddl`` block.
           The ``metadataTable`` parameter defaults to an empty name space, and if this was configured to be anything else previously, DBKVS would not start.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/985>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - We have changed the default ``tablePrefix`` for ``OracleDdlConfig`` to be ``a_``.
           Previously this would default to be empty and so user-defined tables could have a leading underscore, which is an invalid table name for Oracle.
           This change is specific to Oracle and does not affect DBKVS on Postgres.

         - Removed KeyValueService ``initializeFromFreshInstance``, ``tearDown``, and ``getRangeWithHistory``.
           It is likely all callers of tearDown just want to call close, and getRangeWithHistory has been replaced with ``getRangeOfTimestamps``.

         - We have removed references to temp tables and no longer attempt to drop temp tables when aborting transactions.

           Temp tables are not currently being used by any KVSs, yet we were still calling ``dropTempTables()`` when we abort transactions.
           Since dropping tables is a schema mutation, this has the side effect of increasing the likelihood that we lose the schema mutation lock when there are many concurrent transactions.
           Removing temp tables entirely should reduce the need to manually truncate the locks table.

           If your service implements a ``TransactionManager`` and does not extend ``AbstractTransactionManager``, you now have to add a close method to the implementation.
           No operations can be performed using the TransactionManager once it is closed.

           By paging over historical versions of cells during sweeping, we can avoid out of memory exceptions in Cassandra when we have particularly large cells or many historical versions of cells.
           This feature is only implemented for Cassandra KVS and is disabled by default; please reach out to the AtlasDB dev team if you would like to enable it.

           This is expected to perform better than the previous ``getRowsColumnRange``, which allows you to page through columns per row with certain KVS stores (e.g. DB KVS).
           The new method should be preferred unless it is necessary to page through the results for different rows separately.

           Products or clients using wide rows should consider using ``getRowsColumnRange`` instead of ``getRows`` in ``KeyValueService``.

           Details can be found in the :ref:`Leader Configuration <leader-config>` documentation.

           To assist with back compatibility, we have introduced a helper method ``AtlasDbConfigs.addFallbackSslConfigurationToAtlasDbConfig``, which will add the provided ``sslConfiguration`` to ``config`` if the SSL configuration is not specified directly in the ``leader``, ``timestamp``, or ``lock`` blocks.

         - Inserting an empty (size = 0) value into a ``Cell`` will now throw an ``IllegalArgumentException``. (`#156 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/156>`__) Likely empty
           values include empty strings and empty protobufs.

           AtlasDB cannot currently distinguish between empty and deleted cells. In previous versions of AtlasDB, inserting
           an empty value into a ``Cell`` would delete that cell. Thus, in this snippet,

           .. code-block:: java

               Transaction.put(table, ImmutableMap.of(myCell, new byte[0]))
               Transaction.get(table, ImmutableSet.of(myCell)).get(myCell)

           the second line will return ``null`` instead of a zero-length byte array.

           To minimize confusion, we explicitly disallow inserting an empty value into a cell by throwing an
           ``IllegalArgumentException``.

           In particular, this change will break calls to ``Transaction.put(TableReference tableRef, Map<Cell, byte[]> values)``,
           as well as generated code which uses this method, if any entry in ``values`` contains a zero-byte array. If your
           product does not need to distinguish between empty and non-existent values, simply make sure all the ``values``
           entries have positive length. If the distinction is necessary, you will need to explicitly differentiate the
           two cases (for example, by introducing a sentinel value for empty cells).

           If any code deletes cells by calling ``Transaction.put(...)`` with an empty array, use
           ``Transaction.delete(...)`` instead.

           *Note*: Existing cells with empty values will be interpreted as deleted cells, and will not lead to Exceptions when read.

         - Code generation for the ``hashCode`` of ``*IdxColumn`` classes now uses ``deepHashCode`` for its arrays such that it returns
           consistent hash codes for use with hash-based collections (HashMap, HashSet, HashTable).
           This issue will only appear if you are instantiating columns in multiple places and storing columns in hash collections.

           If you are using `Indices <https://palantir.github.io/atlasdb/html/schemas/tables_and_indices.html#indices>`__ we recommend you upgrade as a precaution and ensure you are not relying on logic related to the ``hashCode`` of auto-generated ``*IdxColumn`` classes.
           You will need to regenerate your schema code in order to see this fix.

         - Some logging was missing important information due to use of the wrong substitution placeholder. This version should be taken in preference to 0.7.0 to ensure logging is correct.

         - AtlasDB can now be backed by Postgres via DB KVS. This is a very early release for this feature, so please contact us if you
           plan on using it. Please see :ref:`the documentation <postgres-configuration>` for more details.

    *    - |fixed|
         - The In Memory Key Value Service now makes defensive copies of any data stored or retrieved. This may lead to a slight performance degradation to users of In Memory Key Value Service.
           In Memory Key Value Service is recommended for testing environments only and production instances should use DB KVS or Cassandra KVS for data that needs to be persisted.

         - AtlasDB will no longer log incorrect errors stating "Couldn't grab new token ranges for token aware cassandra mapping" when running against a single node and single token Cassandra cluster.

    *    - |improved|
         - Read heavy workflows with Cassandra KVS will now use substantially less heap. In worst-case testing this change resulted in a 10-100x reduction in client side heap size.
           However, this is very dependent on the particular scenario AtlasDB is being used in and most consumers should not expect a difference of this size.

        - A potential race condition could cause timestamp allocation to never complete on a particular node (#462).

        - An innocuous error was logged once for each TransactionManager about not being able to allocate enough timestamps.
          The error has been downgraded to INFO and made less scary.

        - Serializable Transactions that read a column selection could consistently report conflicts when there were none.

        - An excessively long Cassandra related logline was sometimes printed (#501).

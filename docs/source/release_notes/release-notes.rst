    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |devbreak|
         - ``TimelockDeprecatedConfig`` and ``TimeLockServerConfiguration`` have been removed.
           Note that these configurations were only used for the dropwizard timelock server, which should only be used in tests.
           Now, the dropwizard server launcher uses a similar setup to the use in production, forcing the use of client request limits and lock time limiter.
           Note that this requires converting your existing ``TimeLockServerConfiguration`` to a ``CombinedTimeLockServerConfiguration``.
           For an example of this conversion, refer to the PR below.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3898>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - A new configuration option ``lockImmutableTsOnReadOnlyTransactions`` is added under ``atlas-runtime.transaction``. Default value for this flag is ``false``, and setting it to ``true``
           enables running read-only transactions on thorough sweep tables; but introduces a perf overhead to read-only transactions on conservative sweep tables. This is an experimental feature,
           please do not change the default value for this flag without talking to AtlasDB team.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3888>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``putUnlessExists`` in Cassandra KVS now produces correct cell names when failing with a ``KeyAlreadyExistsException``.
           Previously, Cassandra KVS used to produce incorrect cell names (that were the concatenation of the correct cell name and an encoding of the AtlasDB timestamp).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3882>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Coordination services now only perpetuate an existing value on value-preserving transformations if the existing bound is invalid at a fresh sequence number.
           Previously, we would perpetuate the bound regardless, meaning that when the bound is crossed in a multi-threaded environment, each in-flight transaction that tries to determine its transaction schema version will independently attempt to perpetuate the bound.
           This may lead to multiple unnecessary updates to the coordinated value in a short space of time.
           Note that updates that do change the value will be applied regardless, and could potentially still race if applied in parallel.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3QQQ>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - ``LockRefresher`` now logs at INFO when locks cannot be refreshed in that the server does not indicate that they were refreshed, along with a sample of the lock tokens involved.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3qqq>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - The Cassandra KVS ``CellLoader`` now supports cross-column batching for requests which query a variety of columns for a few rows.
           Previously, we would make separate requests for each of these columns in parallel, creating additional load on Cassandra.
           Internal benchmarks reflect a 4-5x improvement in read p99s for such workflows (e.g. small numbers of rows with static columns, or rows with dynamic columns when the column key is varied and known in advance).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3860>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``WriteBatchingTransactionService`` now tries requests for duplicated timestamps in subsequent batches.
           Previously, we would immediately throw a ``SafeIllegalStateException`` when seeing a duplicate in a single batch, which was causing unnecessary failures in transactions which could handle the ``KeyAlreadyExistsException`` safely.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3879>`__)

    *    - |userbreak| |fixed|
         - AtlasDB Cassandra KVS now depends on sls-cassandra 3.31.0 (was 3.31.0-rc3).
           We do not want to stay on an RC version now that a full release is available.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3872>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Concurrent calls to `TimelockService.startIdentifiedAtlasDbTransaction()` now coalesced into a single Timelock rpc to reduce load on Timelock.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3844>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - `RemoteTimelockServiceAdapter` is now closeable. Users of this class should invoke `close()` before termination to avoid thread leaks.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3844>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Oracle KVS now deletes old entries correctly if using targeted sweep.
           Previously, there were situations where it would not delete values that could safely be deleted.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3870>`__)

    *    - |fixed| |devbreak|
         - Callbacks specified in TransactionManagers will no longer be run synchronously when ``initializeAsync`` is set to true, even if initialization succeeds in the first, synchronous attempt.
           Previously, we would attempt to run the callbacks synchronously when synchronous initialization succeeds, but this prevented use cases where the callback must block until an external resource is available.
           Consequently, even if the initialization of a transaction manager created with asynchronous initialization succeeds synchronously, readiness of the returned object must be checked because transaction managers are not ready to be used until callbacks successfully run.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3865>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Reduced dependency footprint by replacing dependency on groovy-all with dependencies on groovy, groovy-groovysh, and groovy-json.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3886>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed a rare situation in which interrupting a thread could possibly leave dangling locks.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3805>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Cassandra client input and output transports are now properly closed.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3892>`__)

    *    - |fixed| |devbreak|
         - Stop memoizing the ``Supplier`` of ``TimestampService``, as we **must** get a fresh instance on each ``Supplier.get()`` call to ensure correctness after leadership elections.
           Without it, there is a possibility of data corruption if you are running atlas with a leader block in a multi-node configuration.
           Services using External Timelock, Embedded or Leader with 1 node will not be affected.
           Dev break to force ``AtlasDbFactory`` and ``ServiceDiscoveringAtlasSupplier`` to return ``ManagedTimestampService`` which unifies ``TimestampService`` and ``TimestampManagementService``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3911>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Removed unnecessary memory allocations in the lock refresher, and in several other classes, by using Lists.partition(...) instead of Iterables.partition(...).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3918>`__)

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3848>`__)

    *    - |fixed| |userbreak|
         - Background Sweep will now continue to prioritise tables accordingly, if writes to the sweep queue are enabled but targeted sweep is disabled on startup.
           Previously, Background Sweep would not prioritise new writes for sweeping if writes to the sweep queue were enabled.

    *    - |userbreak|
         - AtlasDB Cassandra KVS now depends on sls-cassandra 3.31.0-rc3 (was 3.27.0).
           This version of Cassandra KVS supports a ``multiget_multislice`` operation which retrieves different columns across different rows in a single query.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3849>`__)

    *    - |logs|
         - Added extra debug/trace logging to log the state of the Cassandra pool / application when running into cassandra pool exhaustion errors.

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3829>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Improved the startup check that verifies the correctness of the timestamp source to impose tighter constraints. Now uses a recent value from the puncher store
           rather than the unreadable timestamp.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3825>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``KeyValueService`` and ``CassandraKeyValueService`` in particular now has tighter consistency guarantees in the presence of failures.
           Previously, inconsistent deletes to thoroughly swept tables could result in readers serving stale versions of cells.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3807>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - The contract of ``deleteAllTimestamps`` has been strengthened, and the default implementation has been removed.
           Please contact the AtlasDB team if you think this affects your workflows.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3807>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed a bug in ``PaxosQuorumChecker`` causing a new timelock leader to block for 5 seconds before being able to serve requests if another node was unreachable.

         - ``CassandraKeyValueService`` now exposes a lightweight method for obtaining row keys.
           If you believe you need to use this method, you should reach out to the AtlasDB team first to assess your options.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3757>`__)

    *    - |changed| |userbreak|
         - The minimum Postgres version is now 9.5.2
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3786>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Some race conditions in ``TableRemappingKeyValueService`` and ``KvTableMappingService`` have been fixed.
           Previously, it was possible to run into unexpected instances of ``NullPointerException`` and ``IllegalStateException`` when reading from tables, even when other (completely disjoint) sets of tables were created or dropped.
           It is likely that there remain more bugs here, though we have fixed several more egregious ones.

         - Clients talking to Timelock will now throw instead of making a request with a payload larger than 50MB.
           This addresses several internal issues concerning Timelock stability.
           This is a devbreak in several AtlasDB utility classes used to create clients, where an additional boolean parameter has been added controlling whether its requests should be limited.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3772>`__)

         - Timelock clients now use leased lock tokens to reduce number of RPC's to Timelock server, and improve transaction performance.

         - AtlasDB now supports _transactions2 if backed by Cassandra KVS or In-Memory KVS.
           This is expected to improve transaction performance by making ``putUnlessExists`` faster, and increase stability by avoiding hotspotting of the transactions table in Cassandra.
           This is a beta feature; please contact the AtlasDB team if you are interested to use _transactions2.

         - AtlasDB Cassandra KVS now depends on ``com.palantir.cassandra`` instead of ``org.apache.cassandra``.
           This version of Cassandra thrift client supports a ``put_unless_exists`` operation that can update multiple columns in the same row simultaneously.
           The Cassandra KVS putUnlessExists method has been updated to use the above call.

         - Entries with the same value in adjacent ranges in a timestamp partitioning map will now be properly coalesced, and for the purposes of coordination will not be written as new values.
           Previously, these were stored as separate entries, meaning that unnecessary values may have been written to the coordination store; this does not affect correctness, but is unperformant.

         - AtlasDB now writes to the _coordination table, a new table which is used to coordinate changes to schema metadata internal to AtlasDB across a multi-node cluster.
           Services which want to adopt _transactions2 will need to go through this version, to ensure that nodes are able to reach a consensus on when to switch the transaction schema version forwards.

    *    - |fixed|
         - AtlasDB transaction services no longer throw exceptions when performing Thorough Sweep on tables with sentinels.
           Previously, the services would throw when trying to delete the sentinel, meaning that Background and Targeted Sweep would become stuck if sweeping thorough tables that used to be conservative, or tables that had undergone hard delete via the scrubber.

    *    - |changed| |devbreak|
         - AtlasDB transaction services now no longer support negative timestamps.
           Users are unlikely to be affected, since using transaction services with negative timestamps was already broken in the past owing to the use of negative numbers for special values (like sentinels or a marker meaning that a transaction was rolled back).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/3709>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - With the introduction of _coordination, creation of ``TransactionService`` now requires a ``CoordinationService<InternalSchemaMetadata>``.
           Users may create a ``CoordinationService`` via the ``CoordinationServices`` factory, if needed, or retrieve it from the relevant ``TransactionManager``.
           Generally speaking, ``TransactionService`` should not be directly used by standard AtlasDB consumers; abusing it can result in **SEVERE DATA CORRUPTION**.

         - Cassandra KVS `getMetadataForTables` method now does not contain entries for tables that do not exist in Cassandra.
           Previously, when a table was dropped, an empty byte array would be written into the _metadata table to mark it as deleted.
           Now, we delete all rows of the _metadata table containing entries pertaining to the dropped table.
           Note that this involves a range scan over a part of the _metadata table.
           While it is not expected that this significantly affects performance of table dropping, please contact the AtlasDB team if this causes issues.

         - As part of preparatory work to migrate to a new transactions table, this version of AtlasDB and all versions going forward expect to be using a version of TimeLock that supports the ``startIdentifiedAtlasDbTransaction`` endpoint.
           Support for previous versions of TimeLock has been dropped; please update your TimeLock server.
           Products should depend on TimeLock 0.51.0 or higher, or ignore this dependency altogether if they do not expect to use TimeLock.
           Note that new versions of the TimeLock server still expose the old endpoints, so old clients may still safely use a new TimeLock server.
           Also note that some momentary issues may be faced if one is performing a rolling upgrade of embedded services, though once the upgrades settle services should work normally.
           Note that for or across this version, blue-green deployment of embedded services is not supported.

         - Cassandra KVS no longer uses the schema mutation lock and instead creates tables using an id deterministically generated from the Cassandra keyspace and the table name.
           As part of this change, table deletion now truncates the table before dropping it in Cassandra, therefore requiring all Cassandra nodes to be available to drop tables.
           This fixes a bug where it was possible to create two instances of the same table on two different Cassandra nodes, resulting in schema version inconsistency that required manual intervention.

         - Introduced runtime checks on the client side for timestamps retrieved from timelock. This aims to prevent data corruption if timestamps go back in time, possibly caused by a misconducted timelock migration.

         - ``TransactionManagers`` has a new builder option named ``validateLocksOnReads()``; set to ``true`` by default. This option is passed to ``TransactionManager``'s constructor, to be used in initialization of ``Transaction``.
           A transaction will validate pre-commit conditions and immutable ts lock after every read operation if underlying table is thoroughly swept (Default behavior). Setting ``validateLocksOnReads`` to ``false`` will stop transaction to do the mentioned validation on read operations; causing validations to take place only at commit time for the sake of reducing number of round-trips to improve overall transaction perf.
           This change will cause a devbreak if you are constructing a ``TransactionManager`` outside of ``TransactionManagers``. This can be resolved by adding an additional boolean parameter to the constructor (``true`` if you would like to keep previous behaviour)

           Previously, if there were multiple columns in the row where one was trying to do a CAS, the CAS would be rejected even if the column value matched the cell.
           Similarly, for put-unless-exists, the PUE would be rejected if there were any other cells in the relevant row (even if they had a different column name).

         - Sequential sweep now sleeps longer between iterations if there was nothing to sweep.
           Previously we would sleep for 2 minutes between runs, but it is unlikely that anything has changed dramatically in 2 minutes so we sleep for longer to prevent scanning the sweep priority table too often.  Going forward the most likely explanation for there being nothing to sweep is that we have switched to targeted sweep.
           We don't stop completely or sleep for too long just in case configuration changes and a table is eligible to sweep again.

           This saves an estimated one TimeLock round-trip of latency when starting a transaction.
           Note that the old endpoints are still exposed (so TimeLock remains compatible with older Atlas clients), and there is an automated adapter for new TimeLock clients to talk to old TimeLock servers that don't have this endpoint.

           Note that some metric names have changed; in particular, ``SerializableTransaction.SerializableTransactionConflict`` and ``SnapshotTransaction.SnapshotTransactionConflict`` are now tracked as ``readWriteConflicts`` and ``writeWriteConflicts`` respectively under ``TransactionOutcomeMetrics``.
           This is also an improvement in terms of clarity, as serializable transactions that experienced write-write conflicts were previously marked as snapshot transaction conflicts.

           Please replace any uses of the table-level ``putUnlessExists`` with a get, check and put if appropriate - these will still be transactional because of the AtlasDB transaction protocol.

    *    - |new|
         - Three new conflict handlers ``SERIALIZABLE_CELL``, ``SERIALIZABLE_INDEX`` and ``SERIALIZABLE_LOCK_LEVEL_MIGRATION`` are added.
           ``SERIALIZABLE_CELL`` conflict handler is same as ``SERIALIZABLE``, but checks for conflicts by locking cells during commit instead of locking rows. Cell locks are more fine-grained, so this will produce less contention at the expense of requiring more locks to be acquired.
           ``SERIALIZABLE_INDEX`` conflict handler is designed to be used by index tables. As any write/write conflict on an index table will necessarily also be a write/write conflict on base table, this conflict handler does not check write/write conflicts. Read/write conflicts should still need to be checked, since we do not need to read the index table with the main table. This conflict handler also locks at cell level.
           If your schema already has a table with ``SERIALIZABLE`` conflict handler, and you would like to migrate it to ``SERIALIZABLE_CELL`` or ``SERIALIZABLE_INDEX`` with a rolling upgrade (without a shutdown); then you should first migrate it to ``SERIALIZABLE_LOCK_LEVEL_MIGRATION`` conflict handler to avoid data corruption.

         - AtlasDB metrics are no longer a static singleton, and are now created upon construction of relevant classes.

         - Refactored the TransactionManager inheritance tree to consolidate all relevant methods into a single interface.
           Functionally, any TransactionManager created using TransactionManagers will provide the serializable and snapshot
           isolation guarantees provided by a SerializableTransactionManager. Constructing TransactionManagers via this class

    *    - |changed| |metrics|
         - Sweep metrics have been reworked based on their observed usefulness in the field.
           ``tableBeingSwept`` is removed, as it is observed that it is not ingested as expected. Users can use service logs to track the table being swept.
           ``cellTimestampPairsExamined``, ``staleValuesDeleted`` and ``sweepTimeSweeping`` are being tracked by counters, instead of meters now. This change is done as it is observed that periodically sampled gauge readings are not useful if the frequency is lower than gauge update frequency. Now, these values will be accumulating over time. Users can take the difference of values of two successive points to track the process.
           Sweep now exposes the following metrics with the common prefix ``com.palantir.atlasdb.sweep.metrics.LegacySweepMetrics.`` (To be better distinguished from ``TargetedSweepMetrics``):

              - ``cellTimestampPairsExamined``
              - ``staleValuesDeleted``
              - ``sweepTimeSweeping``

    *    - |improved|
         - When writing to Cassandra, the internal write timestamp for writes of sweep sentinels, range tombstones and deletes to regular tables are now approximately fresh timestamps from the timestamp service, as opposed to being an arbitrary hardcoded value or related to the transaction's start timestamp.
           This should improve Cassandra's ability to purge droppable tombstones at compaction time, particularly in tables that see heavy volumes of overwrites and sweeping.

           Note that this only applies if you have created your Transaction Manager through the ``TransactionManagers`` factory.
           If you are creating your transaction manager elsewhere, you should supply a suitable ``freshTimestampProvider`` in initialization.

         - When determining if large sets of candidate cells were part of committed transactions, Background and Targeted Sweep will now read smaller batches of timestamps from the transaction service in serial.
           Previously, though these reads were re-partitioned into smaller batches, the batch requests were made in parallel which could monopolise Atlas client-side as well as KVS-side resources.
           There may be a small performance regression here, though this change promotes better stability for the underlying key-value-service especially in the presence of wide rows.

         - AtlasDB now partitions versions of cells to be swept into batches more robustly and more efficiently.
           Previously, this could cause stack overflows when sweeping a very wide row, because the partitioning algorithm attempted to traverse a recursive hierarchy of sublists.
           Also, previously, partitioning would require time quadratic in the number of versions present in the row; it now takes linear time.

         - The strategy for choosing the table to compact was adjusted to avoid the case when the same table is chosen multiple times in a row, even if it was not swept between compactions.
           Previously, the strategy to choose the table to compact was:

             1. if possible choose a table that was swept but not compacted
             2. otherwise choose a table for which the time passed between last compact and last swept was longer

           When all tables are swept and afterward compacted, the last point above could choose to compact the same table because ``lastSweptTime - lastCompactTime`` is negative and largest among all tables.

           The new strategy is:

             1. if possible choose a table that was swept but not compacted
             2. if there is no uncompacted table then choose a table swept further after it was compacted
             3. otherwise, randomly choose a table after filtering out the ones compacted in the past hour

         - AtlasDB now supports runtime configuration of throttling for stream stores when streams are written block by block in a non-transactional fashion.
           Previously, such streams would be written using a separate transaction for each block, though in cases where data volume is high this may still cause load on the key-value-service Atlas is using.
           Please note that if you wish to use this feature, you will need to regenerate your Atlas schemas and suitably inject the stream persistence configuration into your stream stores.
           However, if you do not intend to use this feature, no action is required, and your stream stores' behaviour will not be changed.
           Note that enabling throttling may make nontransactional ``storeStream`` operations take longer, though the length of constituent transactions should not be affected.

         - Sweep metrics have been reworked based on their observed usefulness in the field.

           Tagged metrics have been removed as well, and were replaced by a gauge ``tableBeingSwept`` that exposes the name of the table being swept, if it is safe for logging.
           Sweep metrics ``cellTimestampPairsExamined`` and ``staleValuesDeleted`` are now updated after every batch of deletes instead of waiting until all of the batches are processed.

         - AtlasDB will now *fail to start* if a TimeLock block is included in the initial runtime configuration, but the install configuration is set up with a leader block or with remote timestamp and lock blocks.
           Previously, AtlasDB would start successfully under these conditions, but the TimeLock block in the runtime configuration would be silently ignored.
           Note that the decision on whether to use TimeLock or another source of timestamps and locks is made at install-time.

    *    - |improved| |userbreak|
         - AtlasDB users can now specify the usage of TimeLock Server purely by including a TimeLock block in the initial runtime configuration.
           Previously, AtlasDB users would need to specify that they were using TimeLock in the install configuration, possibly with an empty object (``timelock: {}``).
           This is a change from previous behaviour in cases where users specified an embedded install configuration but a TimeLock block in the runtime configuration; previously, the embedded configuration would have been selected, while now the TimeLock configuration will be selected.

           Also, users with scripts that depend on supplying a default runtime configuration may need to be careful to ensure that TimeLock configuration is preserved when such scripts are run.
           That said, AtlasDB will fail to start if trying to access a key-value service where TimeLock has been used as a source of timestamps without going through TimeLock, so we don't think there is a risk of data corruption.

           Stream store value tables are now more likely to be chosen because they contain lots of data per write.
           We ensure we sweep index tables before value tables, and allow a gap after sweeping index tables and before sweeping value tables.

         - Sweep metrics were reworked. Sweep now exposes metrics indicating the total number of cells examined, cells deleted, time spent sweeping, and time elapsed since sweep started on the current table that are updated after each iteration of sweep and separate metrics that are updated after each table is fully swept.
           Additionally, sweep now exposes metrics tagged with table names that expose the total number of cells examined, cells deleted, time spent sweeping per iteration for each table separately.
           Logs will also include the new timing information.
           Sweep now exposes the following metrics with the common prefix ``com.palantir.atlasdb.sweep.metrics.SweepMetric.``:

           A vacuum will be kicked off an a table only if there hasn't been one on the same table in the last ``compactInterval``.
           This will prevent increasing load on Postgres due to queued up vacuums. We would suggest a value of 1-2 days (e.g. ``2d`` or ``2 days``) for this config option
           and would encourage users to test this out and report the results back. We will modify the defaults once this has been field tested.

         - **AtlasDB QoS**: AtlasDB now allows clients to live-reloadably configure read and write limits (in terms of bytes) to rate-limit requests to Cassandra.
           AtlasDB clients will receive a ``RateLimitExceededException`` for requests that are throttled and should handle them appropriately.
           We provide an exception mapper ``RateLimitExceededExceptionMapper`` to map the throttling exceptions to ``429``, but it is upto the application to register the exception mapper.
           Note that this is an experimental feature and applications should generally not enable it by default yet, unless the application has hard read-write limits.
           This should allow us to throttle dynamically in situations where the load on Cassandra is high.

         - When BackgroundSweeper decides to sweep a StreamStore VALUE table, first sweep the respective StreamStore
           INDEX table.
           Before we just swept the VALUE table, which ended up not deleting any values in the backing store.

    *    - |devbreak| |metrics|
         - The method ``AtlasDbMetrics.setMetricsRegistries`` was added, to register both the MetricRegistry and the TaggedMetricRegistry.
           Please use it instead of the old ``AtlasDbMetrics.setMetricsRegistry``.

    *    - |devbreak| |improved|
         - The previously deprecated ``TransactionManagers.create()`` methods have been removed.
           To create a ``SerializableTransactionManager`` please use the ``TransactionManagers.builder()`` to create a ``TransactionManagers`` object and then call its ``serializable()`` method.
           Furthermore, this builder now requires a ``taggedMetricRegistry`` argument, and is a staged builder, requiring all mandatory parameters to be specified in the following order:
           ``TransactionManagers.config().userAgent().metricRegistry().taggedMetricRegistry()``.
           This avoid runtime errors due to failure to specify all required arguments.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed a bug where setting ``compressBlocksInDb`` for stream store definitions would result in a much bigger than intended block size.
           This option is also deprecated, as we recommend ``compressStreamsInClient`` instead.

    *    - |fixed| |metrics|
         - ``MetricsManager`` no longer outputs stack traces to WARN when a metric is registered for a second time.

         - Fixed the deletion of values from the StreamStore when configured to hash rowComponents.
           Previously, due to a deserialization bug, we wouldn't delete the streamed data.
           If you think you're affected by this bug, please contact the AtlasDB team to migrate away from this behavior.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2736>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - We now avoid Cassandra timeouts caused by running unbounded CQL range scans during sweep.
           In order to assign a bound, we prefetch row keys using thrift, and use these bounds to page internally through rows.
           This issue affected tables configured to use THOROUGH sweep strategy — which could accumulate many rows entirely made up of tombstones —
           when Cassandra is configured as the backing store.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2732>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Applications can now easily determine whether their AtlasDB cluster is healthy by querying ``TransactionManager.getKeyValueServiceStatus().isHealthy()``.
           This returns true only if all key value service nodes are up; applications that have sweep and scrub disabled and do not perform schema mutations
           can also treat ``KeyValueServiceStatus.HEALTHY_BUT_NO_SCHEMA_MUTATIONS_OR_DELETES`` as a healthy state.

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``Throwables.createPalantirRuntimeException`` once again throws ``PalantirInterruptedException`` if the original exception was either ``InterruptedException`` or ``InterruptedIOException``.
           This reverts behaviour introduced in 0.67.0, where we instead threw ``PalantirRuntimeException``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2702>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Sweep now waits 1 day after generating a large number of tombstones before sweeping a table again. This behavior only applies when using Cassandra.

         - AtlasDB clients are now able to live reload TimeLock URLs.
           This is required for internal work on running services in Kubernetes.
           We still require that clients are configured to use TimeLock (as opposed to a leader, remote timestamp/lock or embedded service) at install time.
           Note that this change does not affect TimeLock Server, which still requires knowledge of the entire cluster as well.
           Please consult the :ref:`documentation <timelock-client-configuration>` for more detail regarding the config changes needed.

    *    - |deprecated|
         - The ``servers`` block within an AtlasDB ``timelock`` block is now deprecated.
           Please use the live-reloadable ``servers`` block within the ``timelockRuntime`` block of the runtime configuration instead.

    *    - |improved|
         - AtlasDB clients using TimeLock can now start up with knowledge of zero TimeLock nodes.
           Requests to TimeLock will throw ``ServiceUnavailableException`` until the config is live reloaded with one or more nodes.
           If live reloading causes the number of nodes to fall to zero, we also fail gracefully; ``ServiceUnavailableException`` will be thrown until the config is live reloaded with one or more nodes.
           Note that this does not affect remote timestamp, lock or leader configurations; those still require at least one server.
           Also, note that if one is using TimeLock without async initialization, then one still needs to provide information about the TimeLock cluster on startup.

    *    - |improved| |devbreak|
         - ``ServerListConfig`` can now be created with zero servers, as part of work supporting Atlas clients starting up without knowing TimeLock nodes.
           This is strictly more permissive, but may affect developers that use ``ServerListConfig`` directly, especially if it is being serialized.
           (`Pull Request 3 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2647>`__)

    *    - |improved| |logs|
         - kvs-slow-log was added on all Cassandra calls. As with the original kvs-slow-log logs, the added logs have the ``kvs-slow-log`` origin.

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2673>`__)

    *    - |new| |metrics|
         - Metrics were added on all Cassandra calls. The ``CassandraClient`` interface was Tritium instrumented.
           The following metrics have been added, with the common prefix (package) ``com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.cassandra.``:

              - ``CassandraClient.multiget_slice``
              - ``CassandraClient.get_range_slices``

           The following metrics have been added, with the common prefix (package) ``com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.cassandra.``:

              - ``QosMetrics.numReadRequests``

    *    - |new| |metrics|
         - Added metrics for cells read.
           The read cells can be post-filtered at the CassandraKVS layer, when there are multiple versions of the same cell.
           The filtered cells are recorded in the following metrics have been added, with the common prefix (package) ``com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.cassandra.``:

              - ``TimestampExtractor.notLatestVisibleValueCellFilterCount``
              - ``ValueExtractor.notLatestVisibleValueCellFilterCount``

           The cells returned from the KVS layer are then recorded at the metric with the prefix (package) ``com.palantir.atlasdb.transaction.impl.``:

              - ``SnapshotTransaction.numCellsRead``

           Such cells can also be filtered out at the transaction layer, due to the Transaction Protocol. The filtered out cells are recorded in the metrics:

              - ``SnapshotTransaction.commitTsGreaterThatTxTsCellFilterCount``
              - ``SnapshotTransaction.invalidStartTsTsCellFilterCount``
              - ``SnapshotTransaction.invalidCommitTsCellFilterCount``
              - ``SnapshotTransaction.emptyValuesCellFilterCount``

           At last, the metric that record the number of cells actually returned to the AtlasDB client is:

              - ``SnapshotTransaction.numCellsReturnedAfterFiltering``

    *    - |new| |metrics|
         - A metric was added for the cases where a large read was made:

              - ``com.palantir.atlasdb.transaction.impl.SnapshotTransaction.tooManyBytesRead``

           Note that we also log a warning in these cases, with the message "A single get had quite a few bytes...".

    *    - |improved| |devbreak|
         - AtlasDB will now consistently throw a ``InsufficientConsistencyException`` if Cassandra reports an ``UnavailableException``.
           Also, all exceptions thrown at the KVS layer, as ``KeyAlreadyExists`` or ``TTransportException`` and ``NotInitializedException``
           were wrapped in ``AtlasDbDependencyException`` in the interest of consistent exceptions.

         - ``SweeperServiceImpl`` now logs when it starts sweeping and makes it clear if it is running full sweep or not
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2618>`__)

    *    - |fixed| |metrics|
         - ``MetricsManager`` now logs failures to register metrics at ``WARN`` instead of ``ERROR``, as failure to do so is not necessarily a systemic failure.
           Also, we now log the name of the metric as a Safe argument (previously it was logged as Unsafe).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2636>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``SweepBatchConfig`` values are now decayed correctly when there's an error.
           ``SweepBatchConfig`` should be decreased until sweep succeeds, however the config actually oscillated between values, these were normally small but could be larger than the original config.  This was caused by us fixing one of the values at 1.
           ``SweepBatchConfig`` values will now be halved with each failure until they reach 1 (previously they only went to about 30% due to another bug).  This ensures we fully backoff and gives us the best possible chance of success.  Values will slowly increase with each successful run until they are back to their default level.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Check that immutable timestamp is locked on write transactions with no writes.
           This could cause long-running readers to read an incorrect empty value when the table had the ``Sweep.THOROUGH`` strategy.

         - Sweep progress is now persisted as a blob and uses a KVS level table.

           As a result, loading of the persisted SweepResult which was previously linear in the size of the table being swept can be done in constant time.
           No migration is necessary as the data is persisted to a new table ``_sweep_progress2``, however, sweep will ignore any previously persisted sweep progress.
           Note that this in particular means that any in-progress sweep will be abandoned and background sweep will choose a new table to sweep.

           The underlying throttling is the same, however, so Cassandra load shouldn't be impacted.

         - The executors used when async initializing objects are never shutdown anymore.
           You should be affected by this bug only if you had ``AtlasDbConfig.initializeAsync = true``.
           Previously, we would shut down the executors after a successful initialization, which could lead to a race condition with the submission of a ``cancelInitialization`` task.

         - ``getRange`` is now more efficient when scanning over rows with many updates in Cassandra if just a single column is requested.
           Previously, a range request in Cassandra would always retrieve all columns and all historical versions of each column, regardless of which columns were requested.
           Now, we only request the latest version of the specific column requested, if only one column is requested. Requesting multiple columns still results in the previous behavior, however this will also be optimized in a future release.

    *    - |deprecated| |improved|
         - ``SerializableTransactionManager`` is now created via an immutable builder instead of a long list of individual arguments. Use ``TransactionManagers.builder()``
           to get the builder and once completely configured, build the transaction manager via the builder's ``.buildSerializable()`` method.
           The existing ``create`` methods are deprecated and will be removed by November 15th, 2017.

    *    - |devbreak| |improved|
         - ``TransactionManagers.builder()`` no longer has a ``callingClass(..)`` method and now requires the consumer to directly specify their user agent via the previously optional method ``userAgent(..)``.
           All of the ``TransactionManagers.create(..)`` methods are still deprecated, and can be used to specify an empty user-agent.
           We use the user-agent on logs and metrics, so specifying it helps us to diagnose issues in the future.

         - The duration between attempts of whitelist Cassandra nodes was reduced from 5 minutes to 2 minutes, and the minimum period a node is blacklisted for was reduced from 2 minutes to 30 seconds.
           This means we check the health of a blacklisted Cassandra node and whitelist it faster than before.

         - The size of the transaction cache is now configurable. It is not anticipated end users will need to touch this;
           it is more likely that this will be configured via per-service overrides for the services for whom the
           current cache size is inadequate. If needed, configuring this parameter is available under the AtlasDbRuntimeConfig with the name `timestampCacheSize`.

           This is a small API change for users manually constructing a TransactionManager, which now requires a transaction cache size parameter.
           Please add it from the AtlasDbRuntimeConfig, or instead of manually creating a TransactionManager,
           utilize the builder in TransactionManagers to have this done for you.

           Note that even if the config is changed at runtime, the size of the cache doesn't change dynamically until `2565 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/2565>`__ is resolved.

           This will provide more accurate metrics for when sweep is doing something.
           Sweeping through the sweep endpoint will now also contribute to these metrics — before it didn't update any metrics which again distorted the view of what work sweep was doing on the DB.

         - TimeLock Server's ``ClockSkewMonitor`` now attempts to contact all other nodes in the TimeLock cluster, even in the presence of remoting exceptions or clock skews.
           Previously, we would stop querying nodes once we encountered a remoting exception or detected clock skew.
           Also, the log line ``ClockSkewMonitor threw an exception`` which was previously logged every second when a TimeLock node was down or otherwise uncontactable is now restricted to once every 10 minutes.
           Note that the ``clock.monitor-exception`` metric is still incremented on every call, even if we do not log.

         - Async Initialization now works with TimeLock Server.
           Previously, for Cassandra we would attempt to immediately migrate the timestamp bound from Cassandra to TimeLock on startup, which would fail if either of them was unavailable.

         - AtlasDB now supports asynchronous initialization, where ``TransactionManagers.create()`` creates a ``SerializableTransactionManager`` even when initialization fails, for instance because the KVS is not up yet.

           To enable asynchronous initialization, a new config option ``initializeAsync`` was added to AtlasDbConfig.
           If this option is set to true, ``TransactionManagers.create()`` first attempts to create a ``SerializableTransactionManager`` synchronously, i.e., consistent with current behaviour.
           If this fails, it returns a ``SerializableTransactionManager`` for which the necessary initialization is scheduled in the background and which throws a ``NotInitializedException`` on any method call until the initialization completes - this is, until the backing store becomes available.

           While waiting for AtlasDB to be ready, clients can poll ``isInitialized()`` on the returned ``SerializableTransactionManager``.

           The default value for the config  is ``false`` in order to preserve previous behaviour.

    *    - |new|
         - Timelock server can now be configured to persist the timestamp bound in the database, specifically in Cassandra/Postgres/Oracle.
           We recommend this to be configured only for cases where you absolutely need to persist all state in the database, for example,
           in special cases where backups are simply database dumps and do not have any mechanism for storing timestamps.
           This will help support large internal product's usage of the Timelock server.

         - In order to limit the access to inner methods, and to make the implementation of asynchronous initialization feasible, we've extracted interfaces and renamed the following classes:

              - ``LockStore``

         - Timestamp batching has now been enabled by default.
           Please see :ref:`Timestamp Client Options <timestamp-client-config>` for details.
           This should improve throughput and latency, especially if load is heavy and/or clients are communicating with a TimeLock cluster which is used by many services.
           Note that there may be an increase in latency under light load (e.g. 2-4 threads).

         - AtlasDB now offers a simplified version of the schema API by setting the ``enableV2Table()`` flag in your TableDefinition.
           This would generate an additional table class with some easy to use functions such as ``putColumn(key, value)``, ``getColumn(key)``, ``deleteColumn(key)``.
           We only provide these methods for named columns, and don't currently support dynamic columns.
           You can add this to your current Schema, and use the new simplified APIs by using the V2 generated table.

         - AtlasDB now offers specifying ``hashFirstNRowComponents(n)`` in Table and Index definitions.
           This prevents hotspotting by prepending the hashed concatenation of the row components to the row key.
           When using with prefix range requests, the hashed components must also be specified in the prefix.
           Adding this to an existing Schema is not supported, as that would require a data migration.

         - From this version onwards, AtlasDB's metrics no longer have unbounded multiplicity.

         - AtlasDB no longer embeds Cassandra host names in its metrics.

         - TimeLockAgent's constructor now accepts a Supplier instead of an RxJava Observable.
           This reduces the size of the TimeLock Agent jar, and removes the need for a dependency on RxJava.
           To convert an RxJava Observable to a Supplier that always returns the most recent value, consider the method `blockingMostRecent` as implemented `here <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/blob/0.56.0/timelock-agent/src/main/java/com/palantir/timelock/Observables.java#L39-L48>`__.

         - ``BatchingVisitableView`` methods ``immutableCopy``, ``immutableSetCopy``, and ``copyInto`` use the default batch hint of 1000, instead of a batch hint of 100,000.
           We previously defaulted to the higher value because the result set was assumed to be small; however, in practice this has turned out not to be the case, leading to timeouts and OOMs in the field.
           To use a custom batch hint, set the ``batchHint`` property for your ``RangeRequest``.
           Alternatively, call ``BatchingVisitableView.hintBatchSize(int)`` before making a copy.

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2284>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added two new methods to Transaction, getRangesLazy and a concurrent version of getRanges, which are also exposed in the Table API.
           If you expect to only use a small amount of the rows in the provided ranges, it is often advisable to use the new getRangesLazy method and serially iterate over the results.
           Otherwise, you should use the new version of getRanges that allows explicitly operating on the resulting visitables in parallel.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2281>`__)

    *    - |deprecated|
         - The existing getRanges method has been deprecated as it would eagerly load the first page of all ranges, potentially concurrently.
           This often caused more data to be fetched than necessary or higher concurrency than expected.
           Recommended alternative is to use getRanges with a specified concurrency level, or getRangesLazy.

         - AtlasDB no longer embeds user-agents in metric names.
           This affects both AtlasDB clients as well as TimeLock Server.
           All metrics are still available; however, metrics which previously included a user-agent component will no longer do so.
           For example, the timer ``com.palantir.timestamp.TimestampService.myUserAgent_version.getFreshTimestamp`` is now named ``com.palantir.timestamp.TimestampService.getFreshTimestamp``.

    *    - |improved|
         - Cassandra range concurrency defaults lowered from 64x to 32x, to reflect default connection pool sizes

         - If AtlasDB is used with TimeLock, and the TimeLock client name is different than either the Cassandra ``keyspace``, Postgres ``dbName``, or Oracle ``sid``, *AtlasDB will fail to start*.
           This was done to avoid the risk of data corruption if these are accidentally changed independently.
           If the above parameters contradict, please contact the AtlasDB team to change the TimeLock client name. Changing it in config without additional action may result in *severe data corruption*.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2263>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - AtlasDB introduces a top-level ``namespace`` configuration parameter, which is used to set the ``keyspace`` in the keyValueService when using Cassandra and the ``client`` in TimeLock.
           Following the previous change, we unify both the configs that cannot be changed separately in one single config. Therefore it is suggested that AtlasDB users follow and use the new parameter to specify both the deprecated ones.
           Note that if the new ``namespace`` config contradicts with either the Cassandra ``keyspace`` and/or the TimeLock ``client`` configs, *AtlasDB will fail to start*.
           Please consult the documentation for :ref:`AtlasDB Configuration <atlas-config>` for details on how to set this up.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2263>`__)

    *    - |deprecated|
         - As a followup of the ``namespace`` change, the Cassandra ``keyspace`` and TimeLock ``client`` configs were deprecated.
           As said previously, please use the ``namespace`` root level config to specify both of these parameters.

         - Timelock clients now report tritium metrics for the ``TimestampService`` even if they are using the request batching service.
           Note when setting up metric graphs, the timestamp service metrics are named with ``...Timelock.<getFreshTimestamp/getFreshTimestamps>`` when not using request batching,
           but as ``...Timestamp.<getFreshTimestamp/getFreshTimestamps>`` if using request batching.
           The lock service metrics are always reported as ``...Timelock.<lock/unlock/etc>`` for timelock clients.

    *    - |fixed|
         - AtlasDB clients now report tritium metrics for the ``TimestampService`` and ``LockService`` endpoints just once instead of twice.
           In the past, every request would be reported twice leading to number bloat and more load on the metric collector service.

    *    - |new|
         - AtlasDB now produces a new artifact, ``timelock-agent``.
           Users who wish to run TimeLock Server outside of a Dropwizard environment should now be able to do so more easily, by supplying the TimeLock Agent with a *registrar* that knows how to register Java resources and expose suitable HTTP endpoints.

    *    - |improved|
         - TimeLock now creates client namespaces the first time they are requested, rather than requiring them to be specified in config.
           This means that specifying a list of clients in Timelock configuration will no longer have any effect. Further, a new configuration property called ``max-number-of-clients`` has been introduced in ``TimeLockRuntimeConfiguration``. This can be used to limit the number of clients that will be created dynamically, since each distinct client has some memory, disk space, and CPU overhead.

         - KVS migrations will no longer verify equality between the from and to KVSes for the sweep priority and progress tables.
           Note that these tables are still *migrated* across, as they provide heuristics for timely sweeping of tables.
           However, these tables may change during the migration, without affecting correctness (e.g. the from-kvs could be swept).
           Previously, we would attempt to check that the sweep tables were equal on both KVSes, leading to spurious validation failures.

           Please consult the documentation for :ref:`Tables and Indices <tables-and-indices>` for details on how to set this up.
           As AtlasDB regenerates its metadata on startup, changes will take effect after restarting your AtlasDB client (in particular, you do NOT need to rerender your schemas.)
           Previously, all table names, row component names and column names were always treated as unsafe.

         - TimeLock Server, if configured to use the async lock service, will now throw if a client attempts to start a transaction via the sync lock service.

           Previously, users which have clients (for the same namespace) running both pre- and post-0.49.0 versions of AtlasDB were able to run transactions against the sync and async lock services concurrently, thus breaking the guarantees of the lock service.
           AtlasDB does not support having clients (for the same namespace) running both pre- and post-0.49.0 versions.

           Note that TimeLock users which have clients (for different namespaces) running both pre- and post-0.49.0 versions will need to turn this feature off for clients on pre-0.49.0 versions to continue working with TimeLock, and should exercise caution in ensuring that, for each namespace, clients use only pre- or post-0.49.0 versions of AtlasDB.

         - TimeLock Server has moved its parameter ``useAsyncLockService`` to be within an ``asyncLock`` block.
           This was done as we wanted to keep the configuration options for the async lock service together.
           The parameter remains optional, and users not configuring this parameter are unaffected.

         - ``gc_grace_seconds`` will now be automatically updated for services running against CassandraKVS on startup.

           We reduced ``gc_grace_seconds`` from four days to one hour in 0.42.0 but that is enforced for new tables and not the existing ones.
           Updating ``gc_grace_seconds`` can be an expensive operation and users should expect the service to block for a while on startup.
           However, this shouldn't be a concern unless the count of tables is in the order of 100s. If you think this will be an issue,
           please configure the ``gcGraceSeconds`` parameter in Cassandra KVS config to 4 days (``4 * 24 * 60 * 60``), which was the previous default.

         - ``RequestBatchingTimestampService`` now works for AtlasDB clients using TimeLock Server once again.
           Previously in 0.49.0, clients using TimeLock Server and request batching would still request timestamps one at a time from the TimeLock Server.

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |improved|
         - TimeLock Server now can process lock requests using async Jetty servlets, rather than blocking request threads. This leads to more stability and higher throughput during periods of heavy lock contention.
           To enable this behavior, use the ``useAsyncLockService`` option to switch between the new and old lock service implementation. This option defaults to ``true``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2084>`__)

    *    - |devbreak| |improved|
         - The maximum time that a transaction will block while waiting for commit locks is now configurable, and defaults to 1 minute. This can be configured via the ``transaction.lockAcquireTimeoutMillis`` option in ``AtlasDbRuntimeConfig``.
           This differs from the previous behavior, which was to block indefinitely. However, the previous behavior can be effectively restored by configuring a large timeout.
           If creating a ``SerializableTransactionManager`` directly, use the new constructor which accepts a timeout parameter.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2158>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - ``randomBitCount`` and ``maxAllowedBlockingDuration`` are deprecated and no longer configurable in ``LockServerOptions``. If specified, they will be silently ignored.
           If your service relies on either of these configuration options, please contact the AtlasDB team.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2161>`__)

    *    - |userbreak|
         - This version of the AtlasDB client will **require** a version of Timelock server that exposes the new ``/timelock`` endpoints.
           Note that this only applies if running against Timelock server; clients running with embedded leader mode are not affected.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2135>`__)

    *    - |userbreak|
         - The timestamp batching functionality introduced in 0.48.0 is temporarily no longer supported when running with Timelock server. We will re-enable support for this in a future release.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed the broken ``put()`` command in AtlasConsole. You should now be able to insert and update data using Console.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2140>`__)

    *    - |fixed|

    *    - |userbreak|
         - Remove Cassandra config option ``safetyDisabled``;
           users should instead move to a more specific config for their situation, which are:
           ``ignoreNodeTopologyChecks``, ``ignoreInconsistentRingChecks``, ``ignoreDatacenterConfigurationChecks``, ``ignorePartitionerChecks``

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |fixed|
         - If sweep configs are specified in the AtlasDbConfig block, they will be ignored, but AtlasDB will no longer fail to start.
           This effectively fixes the Sweep-related user break change of version ``0.47.0``.
           Note that users of products that upgraded from ``0.45.0`` to ``0.48.0`` will need to move configuration overrides from the regular ``atlasdb`` config to the ``atlasdb-runtime`` config for them to continue taking effect.
           Please reference the Sweep :ref:`configuration docs <sweep_tunable_parameters>` for more details.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2134>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - AtlasDB now supports batching of timestamp requests on the client-side; see :ref:`Timestamp Client Options <timestamp-client-config>` for details.
           On internal benchmarks, the AtlasDB team has obtained an almost 2x improvement in timestamp throughput and latency under modest load (32 threads), and an over 10x improvement under heavy load (8,192 threads).
           There may be a very small increase in latency under extremely light load (e.g. 2-4 threads).
           Note that this is not enabled by default.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2083>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - The ``RateLimitingTimestampService`` in ``timestamp-impl`` has been renamed to ``RequestBatchingTimestampService``, to better reflect what the service does and avoid confusion with the ``ThreadPooledLockService`` (which performs resource-limiting).
           Products that do not use this class directly are not affected.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2083>`__)

    *    - |fixed| |devbreak|
         - ``TransactionManager.close()`` now closes the lock service (provided it is closeable), and also shuts down the Background Sweeper.
           Previously, the lock service's background threads as well as background sweeper would continue to run (potentially indefinitely) even after a transaction manager was closed.
           Note that services that relied on the lock service being available even after a transaction manager was shut down may no longer behave properly, and should ensure that the transaction manager is not shut down while the lock service is still needed.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2102>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``commons-executors`` now uses Java 6 when compiling from source and generates classes targeting Java 6.
           Java 6 support was removed in AtlasDB ``0.41.0`` and blocks certain internal products from upgrading to subsequent versions.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2122>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``LockServiceImpl.close()`` is now idempotent.
           Previously, calling the referred method more than once could fail an assertion and throw an exception.

         - ErrorProne is enabled and not ignored on all AtlasDB projects. This means that AtlasDB can be whitelisted in the internal logging aggregator tool from this version ownards.

    *    - |userbreak| |devbreak| |improved|
         - Added support for live-reloading sweep configurations.
           ``TransactionManagers.create()`` methods now accept a Supplier of ``AtlasDbRuntimeConfig`` in addition to an ``AtlasDbConfig``.
           If needed, the helper method ``defaultRuntimeConfig()`` can be used to create a runtime config with the default values.
           As part of this improvement, we made the sweep options of ``AtlasDbConfig`` unavailable.
           The following options now **may not** be specified in the install config and must instead be specified in the runtime config:

            +-----------------------------------+---------------------------+
            | ``AtlasDbConfig``                 | ``AtlasDbRuntimeConfig``  |

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2106>`__)

    *    - |userbreak|
         - The Atomix algorithm implementation for the TimeLock server and the corresponding configurations have been removed.
           The default algorithm for ``TimeLockServer`` has been changed to Paxos.
           This should not affect users as Atomix should not have been used due to known bugs in the implementation.

    *    - |userbreak|
         - The previously deprecated RocksDBKVS has been removed.

    *    - |fixed| |improved|
         - Sweep now dynamically adjusts the number of (cell, ts) pairs across runs:

           - On a failure run, sweep halves the number of pairs to read and to delete on subsequent runs.
           - On a success run, sweep slowly increases the number of (cell, ts) pairs to read and to delete on subsequent runs, up to a configurable maximum.

           This should fix the issue where we were unable to sweep cells with a high number of mutations.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2060>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Default configs which tune sweep runs were lowered, to ensure that sweep works in any situation. For more information, please check the :ref:`sweep docs<sweep>`.
           Please delete any config overrides regarding sweep and use the default values, to ensure a sane run of sweep.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2104>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - AtlasDB now instruments embedded timestamp and lock services when no leader block is present in the config, to expose aggregate response time and service call metrics.
           Note that this may cause a minor performance hit.
           If that is a concern, the instrumentation can be turned off by setting the tritium system properties ``instrument.com.palantir.timestamp.TimestampService`` and
           ``instrument.com.palantir.lock.RemoteLockService`` to false and restarting the service.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2073>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - AtlasDB now adds endpoints for sweeping a specific table, with options for startRow and batch config parameters.
           This should be used in place of the deprecated sweep CLIs. Check the endpoints documentation `here <http://palantir.github.io/atlasdb/html/cluster_management/sweep/sweep-endpoints.html>`__.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2040>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Improved performance of timestamp and lock requests on clusters with a leader block and a single node.
           If a single leader is configured, timestamp and lock requests will no longer use HTTPS/Jetty.
           In addition to the minor perf improvement, this fixes an issue causing livelock/deadlock when the leader is under heavy load.
           We recommend HA clusters under heavy load switch to using a standalone timestamp service, as they may also be vulnerable to this failure mode.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2091>`__)

    *    - |improved| |devbreak|
         - The dropwizard independent implementation of the TimeLock server has been separated into a new project, ``timelock-impl``.
           This should not affect users directly, unless they depended on classes from within the TimeLock server.

    *    - |fixed|
         - JDBC KVS now batches cells in put/delete operations via the config parameter ``batchSizeForMutations``.
           This will prevent the driver from throwing due to many parameters in the resulting SQL select query. Also,
           the batch size for getRows is now controlled by a config parameter ``rowBatchSize``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2093>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - AtlasDB clients now retry lock requests if the server loses leadership while the request is blocking.
           In the past, this scenario would cause the server to return 500 responses that were not retried by the client.
           Now the server returns 503 responses, which triggers the correct retry logic.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2098>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - AtlasDB now generates Maven POM files for shadowed jars correctly.
           Previously, we would regenerate the XML for shadow dependencies by creating a node with corresponding groupId, artifactId, scope and version tags *only*, which is incorrect because it loses information about, for example, specific or transitive exclusions.
           We now respect these additional tags.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2092>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed a bug where a timelock server instance could get stuck in an infinite loop if cutoff from the other nodes and failed to achieve a quorum.

    *    - |fixed|

         - Upgraded all usages of http-remoting to remoting2.
           Previously, depending on the use case, AtlasDB would use http-remoting, remoting1 and remoting2.
           Developers may need to check their dependencies, as well as update instantiation of their calls to ``TransactionManagers.create()`` to use the remoting2 API.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1999>`__)

    *    - |devbreak| |improved|
         - AtlasDB has updated Feign to 8.17.0 and OkHttp to 3.4.1, following remoting2 in the `palantir/http-remoting <https://github.com/palantir/http-remoting>`__ library.
           We previously used Feign 8.6.1 and OkHttp 2.5.0.
           Developers may need to check their dependencies, especially if they relied on AtlasDB to pull in Feign and OkHttp as there were package name changes.
           (`Pull Request 1 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2006>`__) and

    *    - |devbreak| |improved|
         - AtlasDB now shades Feign and Okio (same as `palantir/http-remoting <https://github.com/palantir/http-remoting>`__).
           This was done to enable us to synchronize with remoting2 while limiting breaks for users of older versions of Feign, especially given an API break in Feign 8.16.
           Users who previously relied on AtlasDB to pull in these libraries may experience a compile break, and should consider explicitly depending on them.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2061>`__)

    *    - |devbreak| |improved|
         - Converted all compile time uses of Guava's ``com.google.common.base.Optional`` class to the Java8 equivalent ``java.util.Optional``.
           This change should not directly affect users as there is no change to `json` or `yml` representations of AtlasDB configurations.
           This is a relatively straightforward compile time break for products consuming AtlasDB libraries.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2016>`__)

    *    - |deprecated| |improved|
         - `AssertUtils` logging methods will now ask for an SLF4J logger to log to, instead of using a default logger.
           This should make log events from AssertUtils easier to filter.

    *    - |fixed|
         - The CLI distribution can now be run against JDBC with hikari connection pools.
           In the past, it would fail to resolve the configuration due to a missing runtime dependency.
           Note: this is not a problem if running with the dropwizard bundle.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2063>`__)

         - Fixed an issue where the lock service was not properly shut down after losing leadership, which could result in threads blocking unnecessarily.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2014>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Lock refresh requests are no longer restricted by lock service threadpool limiting.
           This allows transactions to make progress even when the threadpool is full.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2025>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Lock service now ensures that locks are reaped in a more timely manner.
           Previously the lock service could allow locks to be held past expiration, if they had a timeout shorter than the longest timeout in the expiration queue.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2041>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added a getRow() command to AtlasConsole for retrieving a single row.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1992>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added a rowComponents() function to the AtlasConsole table() command to allow you to easily view the fields that make up a row key.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2037>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - The default lock timeout is now configurable.
           Currently, the default lock timeout is 2 minutes.
           This can cause a large delay if a lock requester's connection has died at the time it receives the lock.
           Since TransactionManagers#create provides an auto-refreshing lock service, it is safe to lower the default timeout to reduce the delay that happens in this case.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2026>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - The priority of logging on background sweep was increased from debug to info or warn.

    *    - |improved|
         - The lock service state logger now has a reduced memory footprint.
           It also now logs the locking mode for each lock.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1891>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Reduced the logging level of some messages relating to check-and-set operations in ``CassandraTimestampBoundStore`` to reduce noise in the logs.
           These were designed to help debugging the ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesException`` issues but we no longer require them to log all the time.

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |improved|
         - ``TimestampService`` now uses atomic variables rather than locking, and refreshes the bound synchronously rather than asynchronously.
           This should improve performance somewhat under heavy load, although there will be a short pause in responses when the bound needs to be refreshed (currently, once every 1 million timestamps).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1910>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Added new meter metrics for cells swept/deleted and failures to acquire persistent lock.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1946>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Cassandra thrift driver has been bumped to version 3.10.
           This will fix a bug (#1654) that caused Atlas probing downed Cassandra nodes every few minutes to see if they were up and working yet to eventually take out the entire cluster by steadily building up leaked connections, due to a bug in the underlying driver.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1970>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Read-only transactions will no longer make a remote call to fetch a timestamp, if no work is done on the transaction.
           This will benefit services that execute read-only transactions around in-memory cache operations, and frequently never fall through to perform a read.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/1996>`__)

    *    - |improved|

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed a severe performance regression in getRange() on Oracle caused by an inadequate query plan being chosen sometimes.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1989>`__)

    *    - |fixed|

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/2003>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - KVS migration CLI will now clear the checkpoint tables that are required while the migration is in progress but not after the migration is complete.
           The tables were previously left hanging and the user had to delete/truncate them.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1927>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - Some downstream projects were using empty table metadata for dev-laziness reasons in their tests.
           This is no longer permitted, as it leads to many (unsolved) questions about how to deal with such a table.
           If this breaks your tests, you can fix it with making real schema for tests or by switching to AtlasDbConstants.GENERIC_TABLE_METADATA
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/1925>`__)

    *    - |userbreak| |fixed|
         - Fixed a bug that caused Cassandra to always use the minimum compression block size of 4KB instead of the requested compression block size.
           Users must explicitly rewrite table metadata for any tables that requested explicit compression, as any tables that were created previously will not respect the compression block size in the schema.
           This can have a very large performance impact (both positive and negative in different cases), so users may need to remove the explicit compression request from their schema if this causes a performance regression.
           Users that previously attempted to set a compression block size that was not a power of 2 will also need to update their schema because Cassandra only allows this value to be a power of 2.

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``PaxosTimestampBoundStore`` now throws ``NotCurrentLeaderException``, invalidating the timestamp store, if a bound update fails because another timestamp service on the same node proposed a smaller bound for the same sequence number.
           This was added to address a very specific race condition leading to an infinite loop that would saturate the TimeLock cluster with spurious Paxos messages; see `issue 1941 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1941>`__ for more detail.

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1936>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Sweep now batches delete calls before executing them.
           This should improve performance on relatively clean tables by deleting more cells at a time, leading to fewer DB operations and taking out the backup lock less frequently.
           The new configuration parameter ``sweepDeleteBatchHint`` determines the approximate number of (cell, timestamp) pairs deleted in a single batch.
           Please refer to the :ref:`documentation <sweep_tunable_parameters>` for details of how to configure this.

    *    - |changed|
         - :ref:`Sweep metrics <dropwizard-metrics>` now record counts of cell-timestamp pairs examined rather than the count of entire cells examined. This provides more accurate insight on the work done by the sweeper.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1911>`__)

    *    - |deprecated|
         - The Sweep CLI configuration parameters ``--batch-size`` and ``--cell-batch-size`` have been deprecated, as we now batch on cell-timestamp pairs rather than by rows and cells.
           Please use the ``--candidate-batch-hint`` (batching on cells) instead of ``--batch-hint`` (batching on rows), and ``--read-limit`` instead of ``--cell-batch-size`` (:ref:`docs <sweep_tunable_parameters>`).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1962>`__)

    *    - |deprecated|
         - The background sweep configuration parameters ``sweepBatchSize`` (which used to batch on rows) and ``sweepCellBatchSize`` have been deprecated in favour of ``sweepCandidateBatchHint`` (which now batches on cells) and ``sweepReadLimit`` respectively.

         - After the Pull Request `#1808 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1808>`__ the TimeLock Server did not gate the lock service behind the ``AwaitingLeadershipProxy``. This could lead to data corruption in very rare scenarios. The affected TimeLock server versions are not distributed anymore internally.

    *    - |fixed|
         - ``TimestampAllocationFailures`` now correctly propagates ``ServiceNotAvailableException`` if thrown from the timestamp bound store.
           Previously, a ``NotCurrentLeaderException`` that was thrown from the timestamp store would be wrapped in ``RuntimeException`` before being thrown out, meaning that TimeLock clients saw 500s instead of the intended 503s. This could lead to inneficient retry logic.

           The cases where this can happen are explained by a race condition that can occur after leadership change, and it is safe to let requests be retried on another server.

         - A 500 ms backoff has been added to the our retry logic when the client has queried all the servers of a cluster and received a ``NotCurrentLeaderException``.
           Previously in this case, our retry logic would dictate infinitely many retries with a 1 ms backoff.
           The new backoff should reduce contention during leadership elections, when all nodes throw ``NotCurrentLeaderException``.

         - Default ``gc_grace_seconds`` set by AtlasDB for Cassandra tables has been changed from four days to one hour, allowing Cassandra to start cleaning up swept data sooner after sweeping.

           This parameter is set at table creation time, and it will only apply for new tables.
           Existing customers can update the ``gc_grace_seconds`` of existing tables to be one hour if they would like to receive this benefit now. We will also be adding functionality to auto-update this for existing tables in a future release.
           There is no issue with having tables with different values for ``gc_grace_seconds``, and this can be updated at any time.

         - Projects ``atlasdb-commons``, ``commons-annotations``, ``commons-api``, ``commons-executors``, ``commons-proxy``, and ``lock-api`` no longer force Java 6 compatibility.
           This eliminates the need for a Java 6 compiler to compile AtlasDB.

         - The format of serialized exceptions occurring on a remote host has been brought in line with that of the `palantir/http-remoting <https://github.com/palantir/http-remoting>`__ library.
           This should generally improve readability and also allows for more meaningful messages to be sent; we would previously return message bodies with no content for some exceptions (such as ``NotCurrentLeaderException``).
           In particular, the assumption that a status code of 503 definitively means that the node being contacted is not the leader is no longer valid.
           That said, existing AtlasDB clients will still behave correctly even with a new TimeLock.

         - TimeLock clients may now receive an HTTP response with status code 503, encapsulating a ``BlockingTimeoutException``.
           This response is returned if a client makes a lock request that blocks for long enough that the server's idle timeout expires; clients may (immediately) retry the request.
           Previously, these requests would be failed with a HTTP-level exception that the stream was closed.
           We have rewritten clients constructed via ``AtlasDbHttpClients`` to account for this new behaviour, but custom clients directly accessing the lock service may be affected.
           This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled following the TimeLock server configuration :ref:`docs <timelock-server-time-limiting>`.

         - AtlasDB will refuse to start if backed by Postgres 9.5.0 or 9.5.1.
           These versions contain a known bug that causes incorrect results to be returned for certain queries.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1820>`__)

    *    - |userbreak| |improved|
         - The lock server now will dump all held locks and outstanding lock requests in YAML file, when logging state requested, for easy readability and further processing.
           This will make debuging lock congestions easier. Lock descriptors are changed with places holders and can be decoded using descriptors file,
           which will be written in the folder. Information like requesting clients, requesting threads and other details can be found in the YAML.
           Note that this change modifies serialization of lock tokens by adding the name of the requesting thread to the lock token; thus, TimeLock Servers are no longer compatible with AtlasDB clients from preceding versions.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1792>`__)

    *    - |devbreak| |fixed|

    *    - |new|
         - The lock server can now limit the number of concurrent open lock requests from the same client.
           This behavior can be enabled with the flag ``useClientRequestLimit``. It is disabled by default.
           For more information, see the :ref:`docs <timelock-server-further-config>`.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1785>`__)

    *    - |devbreak| |new|
         - The ``TransactionManager`` and ``KeyValueService`` interfaces have new methods that must be implemented by applications that have custom implementations of those interfaces.
           These new methods are ``TransactionManager.getKeyValueServiceStatus()`` and ``KeyValueService.getClusterAvailabilityStatus()``.

           Applications can now call ``TransactionManager.getKeyValueServiceStatus()`` to determine the health of the underlying KVS.
           This is designed for applications to implement their availability status taking into account the :ref:`kvs health <kvs-status-check>`.

         - On graceful shutdown, the background sweeper will now release the backup lock if it holds it.
           This should reduce the need for users to manually reset the ``_persisted_locks`` table in the event that they restarted a service while it was holding the lock.

           These are required by the `palantir/http-remoting <https://github.com/palantir/http-remoting>`__ library.
           This behaviour is consistent with our existing behaviour for Jackson modules (JDK 7, Guava and Joda Time).

         - Refactored ``AvailableTimestamps`` reducing overzealous synchronization.
           Giving out timestamps is no longer blocking on refreshing the timestamp bound if there are enough timestamps to give out with the current bound.
           This improves latency of timestamp requests under heavy load; we have seen an approximately 30 percent improvement on internal benchmarks.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1783>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - The lock server now has a ``SlowLockLogger``, which logs at INFO in the service logs if a lock request receives a response after at least a given amount of time (10 seconds by default).
           This is likely to be useful for debugging issues with long-running locks in production.

           Specifically, the timelock server has a configuration parameter ``slowLockLogTriggerMillis`` which defaults to ``10000``.
           Setting this parameter to zero (or any negative number) will disable the new logger.
           If not using timelock, an application can modify the trigger value through ``LockServerOptions`` during initialization in ``TransactionManagers.create``.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Proxies created via ``AtlasDbHttpClients`` now parse ``Retry-After`` headers correctly.
           This manifests as Timelock clients failing over and trying other nodes when receiving a 503 with a ``Retry-After`` header from a remote (e.g. from a TimeLock non-leader).
           Previously, these proxies would immediately retry the connection on the node with a 503 two times (for a total of three attempts) before failing over.

         - The default ``sweepBatchSize`` has been changed from 1000 to 100.
           This has empirically shown to be a better batch size because it puts less stress on the underlying KVS.

         - Fixed a performance regression introduced in `#582 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/582>`__, which caused sub-optimal batching behaviour when getting large sets of rows in Cassandra.
           The benchmark, intentionally set up in `#1770 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1770>`__ to highlight the break, shows a 10x performance improvement.

    *    - Type
         - Change

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed an issue where a ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesError`` would not be propagated from the asynchronous refresh job that increases the timestamp bound.
           This could result in a state where two timestamp services are simultaneously handing out timestamps until the older service's buffer of 1M timestamps is exhausted and fails.
           Now we immediately fail, alerting users much sooner that a ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesError`` has occurred.
           Note that users would still see the error prior to the fix, we now just ensure it is discovered sooner.
           This failure does not affect the Timelock server.
           Furthermore, we improved the logic for increasing the timestamp bound when the allocation buffer is exhausted.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1718>`__)

    *    - |new|

           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1720>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - KVS migrations now maintain the guarantee of the timestamp service to hand out monotonically increasing timestamps.
           Previously, we would reset the timestamp service to 0 after a migration, but now we use the correct logical timestamp.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1199>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Improved performance of paging over dynamic columns on Oracle DBKVS: the time required to page through a large wide row is now linear rather than quadratic in the length of the row.

    *    - |deprecated|
         - ``GenericStreamStore.loadStream`` has been deprecated.

         - ``getAsyncRows`` and ``getAsyncRowsMultimap`` methods have been removed from generated code.
           They do not appear valuable to the API and use an unintuitive and custom ``AsyncProxy`` that was also removed.
           We believe they are unused by upstream applications, but if you do encounter breaks due to this removal please file a ticket with the dev team for immediate support.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1689>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - RemoteLockService clients will no longer silently retry on connection failures to the Timelock server.
           This is used to mitigate issues with frequent leadership changes owing to `#1680 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1680>`__.
           Previously, because of Jetty's idle timeout and OkHttp's silent connection retrying, we would generate an endless stream of lock requests if using HTTP/2 and blocking for more than the Jetty idle timeout for a single lock.
           This would lead to starvation of other requests on the TimeLock server, since a lock request blocked on acquiring a lock consumes a server thread.

         - Fixed DBKVS sweep OOM issue (`#982 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/982>`__) caused by very wide rows.
           ``DbKvs.getRangeOfTimestamps`` uses an adjustable cell batch size to avoid loading too many timestamps.
           One can set the batch size by calling ``DbKvs.setMaxRangeOfTimestampsBatchSize``.

           In case of a single row that is too wide, this may result in ``getRangeOfTimestamps`` returning multiple ``RowResult`` to include all timestamps.
           It is, however, guaranteed that each ``RowResult`` will contain all timestamps for each included column.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Actions run by the ``ReadOnlyTransactionManager`` can no longer bypass necessary protections when using ``getRowsColumnRange()``.
           These protections disallow reads against ``THOROUGH`` swept tables as read only transactions do not acquire the appropriate locks to guarantee transactionality.

         - Fixed an issue where the ``_persisted_locks`` table was unnecessarily logged as not having persisted metadata.
           The ``_persisted_locks`` table is a hidden table, and thus it does not need to have persisted metadata.

    *    - |devbreak| |improved|
         - ``TransactionManager`` now explicitly declares a ``close`` method that does not throw exceptions.
           This makes the ``TransactionManager`` significantly easier to develop against.

         - The background sweeper now uses deleteRange instead of truncate when clearing the ``sweep.progress`` table.
           This allows users with Postgres to perform backups via the normal pg_dump command while running background sweep.
           Previous it was possible for a backup to fail if sweep were performing a truncate at the same time.

    *    - |improved|
         - Cassandra now attempts to truncate when performing a ``deleteRange(RangeRequest.All())`` in an effort to build up less garbage.
           This is relevant for when sweep is operating on its own sweep tables.

         - Timelock server now supports `HTTP/2 <https://http2.github.io/>`__, and the AtlasDB HTTP clients enable a required GCM cipher suite.
           This feature improves performance of the Timelock server.
           Any client that wishes to connect to the timelock server via HTTP/2 must add jetty_alpn_agent as a javaAgent JVM argument, otherwise connections will fall back to HTTP/1.1 and performance will be considerably slower.

           For an example of how to add this dependency, see our `timelock-server/build.gradle <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1594/files#diff-e7db4468f37a8004be3c399d791c323eR57>`__ file.

    *    - |new|
         - Added the option to perform a dry run of sweep via the :ref:`Sweep CLI <atlasdb-sweep-cli>`.
           When ``--dry-run`` is set, sweep will tell you how many cells would have been deleted, but will not actually delete any cells.

           This feature was introduced to avoid accidentally generating more tombstones than the Cassandra tombstone threshold (default 100k) introduced in `CASSANDRA-6117 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6117>`__.
           If you delete more than 100k cells and thus cross the Cassandra threshold, then Cassandra may reject read requests until the tombstones have been compacted away.
           Customers wishing to run Sweep should first run with the ``--dry-run`` option and only continue if the number of cells to be deleted is fewer than 100k.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Persisted locks table is now considered an Atomic Table.

           ``ATOMIC_TABLES`` are those that must always exist on KVSs that support check-and-set (CAS) operations.
           This is particularly relevant for AtlasDB clients that make use of the TableSplittingKVS and want to keep tables on different KVSs.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed erroneous occurrence of ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesError`` (see `#1000 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1000>`__) where the timestamp service was unaware of successfully writing the new timestamp limit to the DB.
           This fix only applies to Cassandra backed AtlasDB clients who are not using the external Timelock service.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1577>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - AtlasDB HTTP clients will now have a user agent of ``<project.name>-atlasdb (project.version)`` as opposed to ``okhttp/2.5.0``.
           This should make distinguishing AtlasDB request logs from application request logs much easier.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1535>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Sweep now takes out a lock to ensure data is not corrupted during online backups.

           Users performing :ref:`live backups <backup-restore>` should grab this lock before performing a backup of the underlying KVS, and then release the lock once the backup is complete.
           This enables the backup to safely run alongside either the :ref:`background sweeper <background-sweep>` or the :ref:`sweep CLI <atlasdb-sweep-cli>`.

         - Improved heap usage during heavy DBKVS querying by reducing mallocs in ``SQLString.canonicalizeString()``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1560>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Removed an unused hamcrest import from the timestamp-impl project.
           This should reduce the size of our transitive dependencies, and therefore the size of product binaries.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1578>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed schema generation with Java 8 optionals.
           To use Java8 optionals, supply ``OptionalType.JAVA8`` as an additional constructor argument when creating your ``Schema`` object.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1501>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - Modified the type signature of ``BatchingVisitableView#of`` to no longer accept ``final BatchingVisitable<? extends T> underlyingVisitable`` and instead accept ``final BatchingVisitable<T> underlyingVisitable``.
           This will resolve an issue where newer versions of Intellij fail to compile AtlasDB.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1582>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Reduced logging noise from large Cassandra gets and puts by removing ERROR messages and only providing stacktraces at DEBUG.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1590>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Upon startup of an AtlasDB client with a ``timeblock`` :ref:`config block <timelock-client-configuration>`, the client will now automatically migrate its timestamp to the the :ref:`external Timelock cluster <external-timelock-service>`.

           The client will fast-forward the Timelock Server's timestamp bound to that of the embedded service.
           The client will now also *invalidate* the embedded service's bound, backing this up in a separate row in the timestamp table.

           Automated migration is only supported for Cassandra KVS at the moment.
           If using DBKVS or other key-value services, it remains the user's responsibility to ensure that they have performed the migration detailed in :ref:`Migration to External Timelock Services <timelock-migration>`.

    *    - |improved| |devbreak|
         - Improved Oracle performance on DBKVS by preventing excessive reads from the _namespace table when initializing SweepStrategyManager.
           Replaced ``mapToFullTableNames()`` with ``generateMapToFullTableNames()`` in ``com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.TableMappingService``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1486>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - Removed the unused ``TieredKeyValueService`` which offered the ability to spread tables across multiple KVSs that exist in a stacked hierarchy (primary & secondary).
           If you require this KVS please file a ticket to have it reinstated.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1553>`__)

    *    - |devbreak|
         - Fast forwarding a persistent timestamp service to ``Long.MIN_VALUE`` will now throw an exception, whereas previously it would be a no-op.
           Calling the ``fast-forward`` endpoint without specifying the fast-forward timestamp parameter will now default to submitting ``Long.MIN_VALUE``, and thus return a HTTP 400 response.

           We are introducing this break to prevent accidental corruption by forgetting to submit the fast-forward timestamp.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1538>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Oracle queries now use the correct hints when generating the query plan.
           This will improve performance for Oracle on DB KVS.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1549>`__)

    *    - |userbreak|
         - Oracle table names can now have a maximum length of 27 characters instead of the previous limit of 30.
           This is to ensure consistency in naming the primary key constraint which adds a prefix of ``pk_`` to the table name.
           This will break any installation of Oracle with the ``useTableMapping`` flag set to ``true``.

           Since Oracle support is still in beta, we are not providing an automatic migration path from older versions of AtlasDB.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1552>`__)

         - Fixed schema generation with Java 8 optionals.
           To use Java8 optionals, supply ``OptionalType.JAVA8`` as an additional constructor argument when creating your ``Schema`` object.

           Additionally, this fix requires all AtlasDB clients to regenerate their schema, even if they do not use the Java 8 optionals.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1501>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Prevent deadlocks in an edge case where we perform parallel reads with a small connection pool on DB KVS.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1468>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added support for benchmarking custom Key Value Stores.
           In the future this will enable performance regression testing for Oracle.

           See our :ref:`performance writing <performance-writing>` documentation for details.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1459>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Don't retry interrupted remote calls.

           This should have the effect of shutting down faster in situations where we receive a ``InterruptedException``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1488>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Added request and exception rates metrics in CassandraClientPool. This will provide access to 1-, 5-, and 15-minute moving averages.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1497>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - More informative logging around retrying of transactions.
           If a transaction succeeds after being retried, we log the success (at the INFO level).
           If a transaction failed, but will be retried, we now also log the number of failures so far (at INFO).
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1376>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Updated our dependency on ``gradle-java-distribution`` from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0.

         - Returned ``RemotingKeyValueService`` and associated remoting classes to the AtlasDB code base.
           These now live in ``atlasdb-remoting``.
           This KVS will pass remote calls to a local delegate KVS.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1304>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Stream store compression, introduced in 0.27.0, no longer creates a transaction inside a transaction when streaming directly to a file.
           Additionally, a check was added to enforce the condition imposed in 0.28.0, namely that the caller of ``AbstractGenericStreamStore.loadStream`` should not call ``InputStream.read()`` within the transaction that was used to fetch the stream.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1460>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - AtlasDB timestamp and lock HTTPS communication now use JVM optimized cipher suite CBC over the slower GCM.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1378>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added a new ``KeyValueService`` API method, ``checkAndSet``.
           This is to be used in upcoming backup lock changes, and is not intended for other usage. If you think your application would benefit from using this directly, please contact the AtlasDB dev team.
           This is supported for Cassandra, Postgres, and Oracle, but in the latter case support is only provided for tables which are not overflow tables.
           ``checkAndSet`` is **not** supported for RocksDB or JDBC.

         - The ``DebugLogger`` class was moved from package ``com.palantir.timestamp`` in project ``timestamp-impl`` to ``com.palantir.util`` in project ``atlasdb-commons``.
           This break is reverted in the next release (AtlasDB 0.29.0) and will not affect services who skip this release.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1445>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Increase default Cassandra pool size from minimum of 20 and maximum of 5x the minimum (100 if minimum not modified) connections to minimum of 30 and maximum of 100 connections.
           This has empirically shown better handling of bursts of requests that would otherwise require creating many new connections to Cassandra from the clients.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1402>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added metrics to SnapshotTransaction to monitor durations of various operations such as ``get``, ``getRows``, ``commit``, etc.
           AtlasDB users should use ``AtlasDbMetrics.setMetricRegistry`` to set a ``MetricRegistry``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1429>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - Added metrics in Cassandra clients to record connection pool statistics and exception rates.
           These metrics use the global ``AtlasDbRegistry`` metrics.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1380>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - There is now a ``TimestampMigrationService`` with the ``fast-forward`` method that can be used to migrate between timestamp services.
           You will simply need to fast-forward the new timestamp service using the latest timestamp from the old service.
           This can be done using the :ref:`timestamp forward cli <offline-clis>` when your AtlasDB services are offline.

           This capability was added so we can automate the migration to an external Timelock service in a future release.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1445>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Allow tables declared with ``SweepStrategy.THOROUGH`` to be migrated during a KVS migration.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1410>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fix an issue with stream store where pre-loading the first block of an input stream caused us to create a transaction inside another transaction.
           To avoid this issue, it is now the caller's responsibility to ensure that ``InputStream.read()`` is not called within the transaction used to fetch the stream.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1447>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - ``atlasdb-rocksdb`` is no longer required by ``atlasdb-cli`` and therefore will no longer be packaged with AtlasDB clients pulling in ``atlasdb-dropwizard-bundle``.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1439>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - All SnapshotTransaction ``get`` methods are now safe for tables declared with SweepStrategy.THOROUGH.
           Previously, a validation check was omitted for ``getRowsColumnRange``, ``getRowsIgnoringLocalWrites``, and ``getIgnoringLocalWrites``, which in very rare cases could have resulted in deleted values being returned by a long-running read transaction.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1421>`__)

    *    - |userbreak|
         - Users must not create a client named ``leader``. AtlasDB Timelock Server will fail to start if this is found.
           Previously, using ``leader`` would have silently failed, since the JAXRS 3.7.2 algorithm does not include backtracking over
           root resource classes (so either leader election or timestamp requests would have failed).

         - Fixed an issue with ``StreamStore.loadStream``'s underlying ``BlockGetter`` where, for non-default block size and in-memory thresholds,
           we would incorrectly throw an exception instead of allowing the stream to be created.
           This caused an issue when the in-memory threshold was many times larger than the default (47MB for the default block size),
           or when the block size was many times smaller (7KB for the default in-memory threshold).

    *    - |new|
         - AtlasDB now supports stream store compression.
           Streams can be compressed client-side by adding the ``compressStreamInClient`` option to the stream definition.
           Reads from the stream store will transparently decompress the data.

           For information on using the stream store, see :ref:`schemas-streams`.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1357>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - ``StreamStore.loadStream`` now actually streams data if it does not fit in memory.
           This means that getting the first byte of the stream now has constant-time performance, rather than
           linear in terms of stream length as it was previously.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1341>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Increased Cassandra connection pool idle timeout to 10 minutes, and reduced eviction check frequency to 20-30 seconds at 1/10 of connections.
           This should reduce bursts of stress on idle Cassandra clusters.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1336>`__)

    *    - |new|
         - There is a new configuration called ``maxConnectionBurstSize``, which configures how large the pool is able to grow when receiving a large burst of requests.
           Previously this was hard-coded to 5x the ``poolSize`` (which is now the default for the parameter).

           See :ref:`Cassandra KVS Config <cassandra-kvs-config>` for details on configuring AtlasDB with Cassandra.

    *    - |improved|
         - Improved the performance of Oracle queries by making the table name cache global to the KVS level.
           Keeping the mapping in a cache saves one DB lookup per query, when the table has already been used.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1325>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - Oracle value style caching limited in scope to per-KVS, previously per-JVM, which could have in extremely rare cases caused issues for users in non-standard configurations.
           This would have caused issues for users doing a KVS migration to move from one Oracle DB to another.

         - Substantially improved performance of the DBKVS implementation of the single-iterator version of getRowsColumnRange.
           Two new performance benchmarks were added as part of this PR:

              - ``KvsGetRowsColumnRangeBenchmarks.getAllColumnsAligned``
              - ``KvsGetRowsColumnRangeBenchmarks.getAllColumnsUnaligned``

    *    - |improved|
         - ``SweepStatsKeyValueService`` will no longer flush a final batch of statistics during shutdown. This avoids

    *    - |improved|
         - Better support for AtlasDB clients running behind load balancers. In particular, if an AtlasDB client falls down and

         - All Oracle table names will be truncated and be of the form: ``<prefix>_<2-letter-namespace>__<table-name>_<5-digit-int>``.
           Previously we only truncated names that exceeded the character limit for Oracle table names.
           This should improve legibility as all table names for a particular application will have identical formatting.

           Oracle is in beta, and thus we have not built a migration path from old table names to new table names.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/1187>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - If using the Dropwizard command to run a KVS migration, the Dropwizard config will be used as the ``--migrateConfig`` config if none is specified.
           Running the KVS migration command as a deployable CLI still requires ``--migrateConfig``.

    *    - |deprecated|
         - ``TableReference.createUnsafe`` is now deprecated to prevent mishandling of table names.
           ``createWithEmptyNamespace`` or ``createFromFullyQualifiedName`` should be used instead.

           Schema generated code still contains use of ``TableReference.createUnsafe`` and is being tracked for removal on `#1172 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/1172>`__.

         - We now provide Oracle support (beta) for all valid schemas.
           Oracle table names exceeding 30 characters are now mapped to shorter names by truncating and appending a sequence number.
           Support for Oracle is currently in beta and services wishing to deploy against Oracle should contact the AtlasDB team.

    *    - |improved|
         - Added a significant amount of logging aimed at tracking down the ``MultipleRunningTimestampServicesError``.
           If clients are hitting this error, then they should add TRACE logging for ``com.palantir.timestamp``.
           These logs can also be directed to a separate file, see the :ref:`documentation <logging-configuration>` for more details.

         - Retrying a Cassandra operation now retries against distinct hosts.

         - The ``clean-cass-locks-state`` CLI clears the schema mutation lock by setting it to a special "cleared" value in the same way that normal lockholders clear the lock.
           Previously the CLI would would drop the whole ``_locks`` table to clear the schema mutation lock.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Fixed an issue where some locks were not being tracked for continuous refreshing due to one of the lock methods not being overridden by the ``LockRefreshingLockService``.
           This resulted in locks that appeared to be refreshed properly, but then would mysteriously time out at the end of a long-running operation.

         - Fixed a regression with Cassandra KVS where you could no longer create a table if it has the same name as another table in a different namespace.

           To illustrate the issue, assume you have namespace ``namespace1`` and the table ``table1``, and you would like to add a column to ``table1`` and `version` the table by using the new namespace ``namespace2``.
           On disk you already have the Cassandra table ``namespace1__table1``, and now you are trying to create ``namespace2__table1``.
           Creating ``namespace2__table1`` would fail because Cassandra KVS believes that the table already exists.
           This is relevant if you use multiple namespaces when performing schema migrations.

           Note that namespace is an application level abstraction defined as part of a AtlasDB schema and is not the same as Cassandra keyspace.

         - Hotspotting warnings, previously logged at ERROR, will now throw ``IllegalStateException`` when generating your schema code.
           Products who hit this warning will need to add ``ignoreHotspottingChecks()`` to the relevant tables of their schema, or modify their schemas such that the first row component is not a VAR_STRING, a VAR_LONG, a VAR_SIGNED_LONG, or a SIZED_BLOB.

           See documentation on :ref:`primitive value types <primitive-valuetypes>` and :ref:`partitioners <tables-and-indices-partitioners>` for information on how to address your schemas.

    *    - |fixed|
         - The ``atlasdb-dagger`` project now publishes a shadowed version so we do not rely on the version of dagger on the classpath.
           This fixes the issue where running the CLIs would cause a ``ClassNotFoundException`` if your application also makes use of dagger.

    *    - |new|
         - Oracle is supported via DBKVS if you have runtime dependency on an Oracle driver that resolves the JsonType "jdbcHandler".
           Due to an Oracle limitation, all table names in the schema must be less than 30 characters long.

           See :ref:`Oracle KVS Configuration <oracle-configuration>` for details on how to configure your service to use Oracle.

         - The DBKVS config now enforces that the namespace must always be empty for ``metadataTable`` in the ``ddl`` block.
           The ``metadataTable`` parameter defaults to an empty name space, and if this was configured to be anything else previously, DBKVS would not start.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/985>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - We have changed the default ``tablePrefix`` for ``OracleDdlConfig`` to be ``a_``.
           Previously this would default to be empty and so user-defined tables could have a leading underscore, which is an invalid table name for Oracle.
           This change is specific to Oracle and does not affect DBKVS on Postgres.

         - Removed KeyValueService ``initializeFromFreshInstance``, ``tearDown``, and ``getRangeWithHistory``.
           It is likely all callers of tearDown just want to call close, and getRangeWithHistory has been replaced with ``getRangeOfTimestamps``.
           Also removed Partitioning and Remoting KVSs, which were unused and had many unimplemented methods.

    *    - |fixed|
         - Dropping a table and then creating it again no longer adds an additional row to the ``_metadata`` table.
           Historical versions of the metadata entry before the most recent one are **not** deleted, so if you routinely drop and recreate the same table, you might consider :ref:`sweeping <sweep>` the ``_metadata`` table.

         - The schema mutation lock holder now writes a "heartbeat" to the database to indicate that it is still responsive.
           Other processes that are waiting for the schema mutation lock will now be able to see this heartbeat, infer that the lock holder is still working, and wait for longer.
           This should reduce the need to manually truncate the locks table.

         - We have removed references to temp tables and no longer attempt to drop temp tables when aborting transactions.

           Temp tables are not currently being used by any KVSs, yet we were still calling ``dropTempTables()`` when we abort transactions.
           Since dropping tables is a schema mutation, this has the side effect of increasing the likelihood that we lose the schema mutation lock when there are many concurrent transactions.
           Removing temp tables entirely should reduce the need to manually truncate the locks table.

         - All TransactionManagers are now AutoCloseable and implement a close method that will free up the underlying resources.

           If your service implements a ``TransactionManager`` and does not extend ``AbstractTransactionManager``, you now have to add a close method to the implementation.
           No operations can be performed using the TransactionManager once it is closed.

         - :ref:`AtlasDB Sweep <physical-cleanup-sweep>` now uses :ref:`column paging <cassandra-sweep-config>` via the ``timestampsGetterBatchSize`` parameter to better handle sweeping cells with many historical versions.

           By paging over historical versions of cells during sweeping, we can avoid out of memory exceptions in Cassandra when we have particularly large cells or many historical versions of cells.
           This feature is only implemented for Cassandra KVS and is disabled by default; please reach out to the AtlasDB dev team if you would like to enable it.

    *    - |new|
         - Added a second implementation of ``getRowsColumnRange`` method which allows you to page through dynamic columns in a single iterator.
           This is expected to perform better than the previous ``getRowsColumnRange``, which allows you to page through columns per row with certain KVS stores (e.g. DB KVS).
           The new method should be preferred unless it is necessary to page through the results for different rows separately.

           Products or clients using wide rows should consider using ``getRowsColumnRange`` instead of ``getRows`` in ``KeyValueService``.

           This is useful on Cassandra KVS if an AtlasDB client goes down during a schema mutation and does not release the schema mutation lock, preventing other clients from continuing.
           Previously an error message would direct users to manually truncate this table with CQL, but now this error message references the CLI.

         - ``TransactionManagers.create()`` no longer takes in an argument of ``Optional<SSLSocketFactory> sslSocketFactory``.
           Instead, security settings between AtlasDB clients are now specified directly in configuration via the new optional parameter ``sslConfiguration`` located in the ``leader``, ``timestamp``, and ``lock`` blocks.
           Details can be found in the :ref:`Leader Configuration <leader-config>` documentation.

           To assist with back compatibility, we have introduced a helper method ``AtlasDbConfigs.addFallbackSslConfigurationToAtlasDbConfig``, which will add the provided ``sslConfiguration`` to ``config`` if the SSL configuration is not specified directly in the ``leader``, ``timestamp``, or ``lock`` blocks.

           For Dropwizard applications, this is only a breaking change if you try to initialize your KeyValueService after having initialized the Dropwizard application.

           This means that products can add default truststore and keystore configuration to their AtlasDB config without overriding previously made SSL decisions (setting ``ssl: false`` should cause SSL to not be used).

           This only affects end users who have deployed products with AtlasDB 0.11.0 or 0.11.1; users upgrading from earlier versions will not see changed behavior.

         - Inserting an empty (size = 0) value into a ``Cell`` will now throw an ``IllegalArgumentException``. (`#156 <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/156>`__) Likely empty
           values include empty strings and empty protobufs.

           AtlasDB cannot currently distinguish between empty and deleted cells. In previous versions of AtlasDB, inserting
           an empty value into a ``Cell`` would delete that cell. Thus, in this snippet,

           .. code-block:: java

               Transaction.put(table, ImmutableMap.of(myCell, new byte[0]))
               Transaction.get(table, ImmutableSet.of(myCell)).get(myCell)

           the second line will return ``null`` instead of a zero-length byte array.

           To minimize confusion, we explicitly disallow inserting an empty value into a cell by throwing an
           ``IllegalArgumentException``.

           In particular, this change will break calls to ``Transaction.put(TableReference tableRef, Map<Cell, byte[]> values)``,
           as well as generated code which uses this method, if any entry in ``values`` contains a zero-byte array. If your
           product does not need to distinguish between empty and non-existent values, simply make sure all the ``values``
           entries have positive length. If the distinction is necessary, you will need to explicitly differentiate the
           two cases (for example, by introducing a sentinel value for empty cells).

           If any code deletes cells by calling ``Transaction.put(...)`` with an empty array, use
           ``Transaction.delete(...)`` instead.

           *Note*: Existing cells with empty values will be interpreted as deleted cells, and will not lead to Exceptions when read.

         - Code generation for the ``hashCode`` of ``*IdxColumn`` classes now uses ``deepHashCode`` for its arrays such that it returns
           consistent hash codes for use with hash-based collections (HashMap, HashSet, HashTable).
           This issue will only appear if you are instantiating columns in multiple places and storing columns in hash collections.

           If you are using `Indices <https://palantir.github.io/atlasdb/html/schemas/tables_and_indices.html#indices>`__ we recommend you upgrade as a precaution and ensure you are not relying on logic related to the ``hashCode`` of auto-generated ``*IdxColumn`` classes.

         - AtlasDB can now be backed by Postgres via DB KVS. This is a very early release for this feature, so please contact us if you
           plan on using it. Please see :ref:`the documentation <postgres-configuration>` for more details.

    *    - |fixed|
         - The In Memory Key Value Service now makes defensive copies of any data stored or retrieved. This may lead to a slight performance degradation to users of In Memory Key Value Service.
           In Memory Key Value Service is recommended for testing environments only and production instances should use DB KVS or Cassandra KVS for data that needs to be persisted.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/552>`__)

    *    - |fixed|
         - AtlasDB will no longer log incorrect errors stating "Couldn't grab new token ranges for token aware cassandra mapping" when running against a single node and single token Cassandra cluster.
           (`Pull Request <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/634>`__)

    *    - |improved|
         - Read heavy workflows with Cassandra KVS will now use substantially less heap. In worst-case testing this change resulted in a 10-100x reduction in client side heap size.
           However, this is very dependent on the particular scenario AtlasDB is being used in and most consumers should not expect a difference of this size.

        - A potential race condition could cause timestamp allocation to never complete on a particular node (#462).

    *   - |fixed|
        - An innocuous error was logged once for each TransactionManager about not being able to allocate enough timestamps.
          The error has been downgraded to INFO and made less scary.

    *   - |fixed|
        - Serializable Transactions that read a column selection could consistently report conflicts when there were none.

    *   - |fixed|
        - An excessively long Cassandra related logline was sometimes printed (#501).

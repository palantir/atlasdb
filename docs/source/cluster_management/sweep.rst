AtlasDB Sweep Job
=================

.. warning::

   AtlasDB sweep is currently an experimental feature, and is disabled by default. If you are interested in testing it, please contact the AtlasDB team.

.. warning::

   Running the Sweep Job while taking a Backup can cause **SEVERE DATA CORRUPTION** to your Backup.


Under normal usage, the data written to the key value service backing AtlasDB is never updated or deleted.
When a row in AtlasDB is "updated", a new version of the row with a higher timestamp is written.
The old row is left untouched. When that row is later read, only the version with the higher timestamp is returned.
Deletions in AtlasDB are similar; in practice they are the same as updates with an empty value.

To prevent an AtlasDB database from growing in size indefinitely, old versions of rows can be deleted through a process called sweeping.
At a high level, this works by periodically scanning the database for rows with multiple versions and deleting the older versions from the database.


Reasons to Sweep
----------------

1. Freeing up Disk Space
    - Putting large amounts of data into cells that are updated creates tables that hold onto data that isn't used. These tables are good candidates to sweep if you want to reclaim disk space.

2. Improving Performance
    - Making many edits to the same row will leave behind many tombstoned entries, so it's advantageous to sweep these tables to increase performance.

3. Improving Stability
    - We have seen situations in the field where reading rows with many historical values caused the underlying Cassandra KVS to run out of memory.
      This situation could have been mitigating by sweeping the table in question.


Ways to Sweep
-------------

- :ref:`Background sweep process<background_sweep>` scheduled periodically:
  Under normal use, the sweep job is intended to run at a constant interval as a background sweep process that does not consume significant system resources.

- :ref:`Sweep CLI<atlas_sweep_cli>` triggered manually:
  You may trigger the sweep job on demand via the sweep CLI. This could be useful in order to address any one-off performance issues.
  Also, long-running AtlasDB instances with high data scale and months/years of user activity that want to enable the background sweep job
  may benefit from manually sweeping specific tables first, to reduce the number of unused cells that have accumulated over time.


.. _sweep_tunable_parameters:

Tunable Configuration Options
-----------------------------

The following optional parameters can be tuned to optimize Sweep performance for a specific AtlasDB instance.
You may set them as part of your :ref:`AtlasDB configuration <atlas_config>`, or as a CLI option if you are running sweep using the CLI.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "AtlasDB Config", "CLI Option", "Default", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 20, 40, 200

   ``sweepBatchSize``, ``--batch-size``, "1,000", "Maximum number of rows to sweep at once. Decrease this if sweep fails to complete (for example if the sweep job or the underlying KVS runs out of memory). Increasing it may improve sweep performance."
   ``sweepCellBatchSize``, ``--cell-batch-size``, "10,000", "Maximum number of cells to sweep at once. Similar to ``maxBatchSize`` but provides finer control if the row widths vary greatly."
   ``sweepPauseMillis``, ``--sleep``, "0 ms", "Wait time between row batches. Set this if you want to use less shared DB resources, for example if you run sweep during user-facing hours."
   "``timestampsGetterBatchSize`` under ``keyValueService`` (see :ref:`Cassandra KVS config <cassandra-configuration>`)", "Not available, the CLI will pick up the value from the config", "Absent (fetch all columns)", "(Cassandra KVS only): Specify a limit on the maximum number of columns to fetch in a single database query. Set this if your Cassandra OOMs when attempting to run sweep with even a small row batch size."

Following is more information about when each of the batching parameters is useful.

``sweepBatchSize`` determines the maximum number of rows to sweep at a time.
The ``sweepPauseMillis`` controls the pause time between sweeping this many rows.

Since the number of columns per row can vary widely between tables, setting just a row batch size can lead to sweep batches containing different numbers of cells; setting ``sweepCellBatchSize`` can even this out.
For example, consider a database that has one table having 1000 rows and 10 columns, a second table having 1000 rows and 100 columns, and that performs best when sweeping at most 10,000 cells at a time.
Without the ``sweepCellBatchSize`` parameter, you would have to limit ``sweepBatchSize`` to 100 to ensure that at most 10,000 cells are swept at a time, and would needlessly page 10 times over the first table.
Setting ``sweepCellBatchSize`` to 10,000 would allow both tables to be swept in optimal batches.
In the future, we may deprecate ``sweepBatchSize`` in preference for ``sweepCellBatchSize``.

The sweep job works by requesting at least one full row at a time from the KVS. In some rare cases (most likely when storing large values), the Cassandra KVS will not be able to construct even a single row at a time;
this situation will manifest as Cassandra OOMing during sweep even if ``sweepBatchSize`` is set to 1.
If that happens, you can use ``timestampsGetterBatchSize`` to instruct Cassandra to read a smaller number of columns at a time before aggregating them into a single row metadata to pass on to the sweeper.
If ``timestampsGetterBatchSize`` is set, Cassandra will read at most one row at a time.
The other batch parameters are still respected, but their values are unlikely to matter because the execution time will be dominated by the single-row reads.

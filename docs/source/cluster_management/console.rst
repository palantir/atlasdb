Overview
========

The AtlasDB Console is intended for use by engineers interested in
examining the internals of a running AtlasDB instance. It supports both
simple and complex quieries on all tables in AtlasDB, as well as
put/get/delete requests, tabular pretty print, and transactions. The
primary high-level goals for AtlasDB Console are simplicity and ease of
user. You can query AtlasDB Console using a Groovy shell or write
scripts as needed to obtain the information you are interested in. There
is a lot of functionality built into this interface and you are able to
perform both safe and destructive (read dangerous) operations.

Getting Started
===============

This section provides basic instructions for navigating AtlasDB Console.
By following the steps below, you can learn how to import sample data
and run basic queries that will give you some insight into how your data
is stored in AtlasDB. If you have not used Groovy or GroovyShell before,
you may wish to refer to `using
Groovy <#using-groovy-in-atlasdb-console>`__ before you start.

Incomplete - pending transfer from internal documentation.

Using Groovy in AtlasDB Console
===============================

This section contains tips and tricks for navigating GroovyShell and
using Groovy to its fullest extent in AtlasDB Console.

-  Type ``:help`` or ``:h`` to get usage help.
-  Type ``help()`` to examine all AtlasDB related functions available.
-  Type ``:exit`` or ``:x`` to exit GroovyShell.
-  Type ``:clear`` or ``:c`` to exit a command block.
-  To use an external editor to write a script without exiting
   GroovyShell, type ``:edit``. Before you use this command for the
   first time, you will need to set your default editor (either vim or
   emacs) using the command ``:set editor vim`` or
   ``:set editor emacs``.
-  To load and run a Groovy script, type
   ``:load <PATH-TO-FILE>/<FILENAME>.groovy``. The file you load must
   end with the ``.groovy`` extension.
-  To record your AtlasDB Console session, type
   ``:record start <PATH-TO-RECORD-FILE>/<FILENAME>.txt``. You can also
   just type ``:record start`` and GroovyShell will save your session to
   a .txt file in your ``/tmp`` directory. GroovyShell will record
   anything typed on the command line or returned by a command to the
   file. You can end the recording by typing ``:record stop`` or review
   the name of the record file and its current size by typing
   ``:record status``.
-  To view a list of all of the commands you have executed so far, type
   ``:history``.
-  If you want the editor to print out the last result (e.g. printing
   the results of a command like ``table('my_table').getRange()``
   without a ``print`` or ``pp`` command), type
   ``:set show-last-result true`` to turn it on. This option is disabled
   by default.
-  You can run scripts on load by setting the --script flag like this:
   ``./bin/unix/atlasDBConsole-script <PATH-TO-FILE>/<FILENAME>.groovy``.
   The script you load must end with the ``.groovy`` extension. This
   will load the script, run it, and exit the console. To keep the
   console running after the script executes, run
   ``./bin/unix/atlasDBConsole <PATH-TO-FILE>/<FILENAME>.groovy``
   (without the ``-script`` flag).

Writing Scripts in Groovy

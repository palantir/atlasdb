Command Line Utilities
======================

Overview
========

For certain pieces of common functionality AtlasDB offers command line
scripts. These scripts can be used to help automate common maintance
tasks as well as help resolve problems encountered during operation.

Writing Your Own
================

You can write a new CLI by extending ``SingleBackendCommand.java`` which
offers default AtlasDB configuration and connection out of the box.


Compiling The CLI
=================

Right now, the best way to get the CLI is by cloning the atlasdb source code and running:

.. code:: bash

     $ ./gradlew atlasdb-cli:distZip
     
     
     
Build In Commands
=================

The following useful commands come with the vanilla atlasdb-cli.

sweep
-----

Sweep old table rows. This can be useful for improving performance if having too many dead cells is impacting read times.  The command allows you to specify a namespace or a specific set of tables. Run ``./bin/atlasdb help sweep`` for more information.


timestamp
---------

Read or recalculate the immutable timestamp. Run ``./bin/atlasdb help timestamp`` for more information.

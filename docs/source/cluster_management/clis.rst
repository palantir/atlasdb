Command Line Utilities
======================

Overview
========

For certain pieces of common functionality AtlasDB offers command line
scripts. These scripts can be used to help automate common maintance
tasks as well as help resolve problems encountered during operation.

Writing Your Own
================

You can write a new CLI by extending ``SingleBackendCommand.java`` which
offers default AtlasDB configuration and connection out of the box.

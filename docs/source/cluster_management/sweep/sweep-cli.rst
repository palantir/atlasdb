AtlasDB Sweep CLI
=================

.. note::
  For instructions on how to run an AtlasDB CLI, see :ref:`Command Line Utilities <clis>`.
  If you are using a recent version of AtlasDB, it may be easier to run the command via the
  :ref:`Dropwizard Bundle <dropwizard-bundle>` instead.

If you ever need to force a particular table or namespace to be swept immediately, you can run the CLI ``./bin/atlasdb sweep``.
The CLI has the following arguments:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Short option", "Long option", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 40, 200

   ``-a``, ``--all``, "Sweep all tables, in all AtlasDB namespaces."
   ``-n``, ``--namespace <namespace name>``, "A namespace name to sweep, for instance ``-n product``"
   ``-t``, ``--table <table name>``, "A fully qualified table name to sweep. For example, to sweep the accounts table in the bank namespace, you would use ``-t bank.accounts``."
   ``-r``, ``--row <row name>``, "A row name encoded in hexadecimal to start sweeping from. The CLI prints out row names as it runs, so you can use this to easily resume a manual sweep job without unnecessarily processing rows that have already been recently swept. If this option is omitted, sweeping will process all rows of the table."
   , ``--dry-run``, "Perform a dry run of sweep. Instead of actually deleting cells, this will tell you how many cells would be deleted. Note that running a dry run and then running a regular sweep may produce slightly different results, as more data may have been added to the database in the meantime."

You must specify exactly one of ``-a``, ``-n``, and ``-t``. If you are sweeping a specific table with ``-t``, you may additionally specify the start row with ``-r``. This is useful for resuming failed jobs.

Additionally, see the list of :ref:`tunable sweep parameters <sweep_tunable_parameters>` if the defaults are not working well for your AtlasDB instance.

Be aware that manual sweeping will ignore all conditions that factor into determining whether background sweepers should run, and that the background sweeper will also be affected by system property changes.

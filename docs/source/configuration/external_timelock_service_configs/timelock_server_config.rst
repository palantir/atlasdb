Timelock Server Configuration
=============================

The Timelock Server configuration file is written in YAML and is located at ``var/conf/timelock.yml``.
It has three main configuration blocks: ``clients``, ``cluster``, and ``algorithm``. We will discuss how each of
these may be configured in turn, as well as additional configuration parameters.

.. contents::
   :local:

Clients
-------

The ``clients`` block is a list of strings which corresponds to client namespaces that the server will respond to.
At least one client must be configured for the Timelock Server to work. Querying an endpoint for a client that does not
exist will result in a 404. Note that client names must consist of only alphanumeric characters, dashes and
underscores (succinctly, ``[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+``) and for backwards compatibility cannot be the reserved word ``leader``.

   .. code:: yaml

      clients:
        - tom
        - jerry

A single Timelock Server or cluster of Timelock Servers can support multiple AtlasDB clients. When querying a
Timelock Server, clients must supply a namespace for which they are requesting timestamps or locks in the form of a
path variable. There are no guarantees of relationships between timestamps requested from different namespaces.

   .. code:: bash

      curl -XPOST localhost:8080/tom/timestamp/fresh-timestamp
      curl -XPOST localhost:8080/jerry/timestamp/fresh-timestamp # no guarantees of any relationship between the values

This is done for performance reasons: consider that if we maintained a global timestamp across all clients, then
requests from each of these clients would need to all be synchronized.

Cluster
-------

.. note::

   You will probably want to use an odd number of servers; using an even number of servers increases the overhead
   of distributed consensus while not actually providing any additional fault tolerance as far as obtaining a quorum
   is concerned. Using more servers leads to improved fault tolerance at the expense of additional overhead incurred
   in leader election and consensus.

The ``cluster`` block is used to identify the servers which make up a Timelock Service cluster. An example is as
follows:

   .. code:: yaml

      cluster:
        localServer: palantir-1.com:8080
        servers:
          - palantir-1.com:8080
          - palantir-2.com:8080
          - palantir-3.com:8080

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - localServer
     - A string following the form ``hostname:port`` which matches the host on which this config exists.

   * - servers
     - A list of strings following the form ``hostname:port`` identifying the hosts in this Timelock
       Service cluster. Note that this list must include the ``localServer``.

Algorithm
---------

We have implemented the consensus algorithm required by the Timelock Server using the Paxos algorithm.
Currently, this is the only supported implementation, though there may be more in the future.
We identify an algorithm by its ``type`` field first; algorithms can have additional algorithmic-specific
customisable parameters as well.

Paxos Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The algorithm has several configurable parameters; all parameters (apart from ``type``) are optional and have
default values.

   .. code:: yaml

      algorithm:
        type: paxos
        paxosDataDir: var/log/paxos
        sslConfiguration:
          trustStorePath: var/security/trustStore.jks
        pingRateMs: 5000
        maximumWaitBeforeProposalMs: 1000
        leaderPingResponseWaitMs: 5000

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - type
     - The type of algorithm to use; currently only ``paxos`` is supported.

   * - paxosDataDir
     - A path corresponding to the location in which Paxos will store its logs (of accepted promises and learned
       values) (default: ``var/data/paxos``). The Timelock Server will fail to start if this directory does not
       exist and cannot be created.

   * - sslConfiguration
     - Security settings for communication between Timelock Servers, following the
       `palantir/http-remoting <https://github.com/palantir/http-remoting/blob/develop/ssl-config/src/main/java/com/palantir/remoting1/config/ssl/SslConfiguration.java>`__
       library (default: no SSL).

   * - pingRateMs
     - The interval between followers pinging leaders to check if they are still alive, in ms (default: ``5000``).
       The server will fail to start if this is not positive.

   * - maximumWaitBeforeProposalMs
     - The maximum wait before a follower proposes leadership if it believes the leader is down, or before
       a leader attempts to propose a value again if it couldn't obtain a quorum, in ms (default: ``1000``).

   * - leaderPingWaitResponseMs
     - The length of time between a follower initiating a ping to a leader and, if it hasn't received a response,
       believing the leader is down, in ms (default: ``5000``).

Further Configuration Parameters
--------------------------------

The Timelock Server is implemented as a Dropwizard application, and may thus be suitably configured with a ``server``
block following `Dropwizard's configuration <http://www.dropwizard.io/0.9.3/docs/manual/configuration.html>`__. This
may be useful if, for example, one needs to change the application and/or admin ports for the Timelock Server.

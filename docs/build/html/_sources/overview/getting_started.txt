Running from Source
===================

1. Clone the git repository:
   ``git clone git@github.com:palantir/atlasdb.git; cd atlasdb``.
2. Generate IDE configuration: ``./gradlew eclipse`` or
   ``./gradlew idea``.
3. Import projects into Eclipse/Intellij.

There are some examples of how to write queries in the `github examples
directory <https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/tree/develop/examples>`__.

Depending on Published Artifacts
================================

AtlasDB is `hosted on
bintray <https://bintray.com/palantir/releases/atlasdb/view>`__. To
include in a gradle project:

1. Add bintray to your repository list:

   .. code:: javascript

       repositories {
           maven {
               url 'https://dl.bintray.com/palantir/releases/'
           }
       }

2. Add the atlasdb-client dependency to projects using AtlasDB:

   .. code:: javascript

       dependencies {
           compile 'com.palantir.atlasdb:atlasdb-client:0.3.3'
       }

Standalone JSON/REST Server
===========================

The standalone server is a lightweight way to try out AtlasDB and can be
done by running AtlasDbServer in the atlasdb-server project.

.. code:: bash

    AtlasDbServer server src/dist/atlasdb_standalone.yml

This is dropwizard service that runs all the needed parts and doesn't
force you to use the java client to get the benefits of atlas. See the
:ref:`atlas-server-api` for more details.

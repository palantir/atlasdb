/**
 * This class serves as a bridge to allow newer Atlas clients to maintain compatibility with TimeLock servers that
 * do not support the {@link TimelockService::startAtlasDbTransaction()} operation.
 *
 * Initially, we assume that the server does support this operation. If we get a 404, we assume that the server does
 * not support this. We try the new endpoints once an hour in case someone upgraded TimeLock (that said, if a user
 * wants to see the perf gain more quickly, a rolling bounce works).
 *
 * There is a risk of a race condition in terms of multiple threads updating serverSupportsStartAtlasDbTransaction to
 * different values. This only arises if starting a transaction takes in excess of the period of the rate limiter
 * (one hour by default), so we believe it is unlikely. We also are not dependent on this for correctness, only for
 * performance.

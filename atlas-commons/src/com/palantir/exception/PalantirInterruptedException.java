/**InterruptedExceptions are now thrown out of SQL calls. Generally speaking, we just want to propagate them.
 * Having a whole bunch of 'throws' and 'catch throws' is ugly & unnecessary (since in theory, code where an exception can
 * mess up data integrity in the db should be wrapped in a transaction).
 * <p>
 * The contract for {@link InterruptedException} states that if you don't handle the interrupt you
 * should either drop the interrupt flag on the thread or rethrow an {@link InterruptedException}.
 * If a {@link PalantirInterruptedException} is thrown instead of an {@link InterruptedException}
 * we should leave the interrupt flag set on the current thread to obey this contract.

/**
 * This annotation should be used to annotate functions that properly handle being interrupted.  In general, these
 * methods should only call other methods which are Interruptible.  Otherwise, if a Interruptible method calls one
 * which is not interruptible in general, the specific use of that other method must be safe under interrupt.
 *
 * A method is Interruptible if:
 * 1. Interrupting the calling thread cannot possibly cause inconsistent state during the run of that method
 * 		(won't break anything).
 * 2. The method does not swallow InterruptedExceptions or the interrupted bit on its calling thread.
 * 		It either rethrows the InterruptedException or resets the interrupted bit on its calling thread (in which
 * 		case it may also throw some other exception).
 * 3. The method explicitly or implicitly checks the interrupted bit before/during expensive processing.  This will
 * 		usually be implicit (any time you use java.concurrent classes to block, or anything else that legitimately throws an
 * 		InterruptedException, will be somehow checking that bit).  However, a very expensive process that does not block
 * 		might need to check this bit explicitly.  See {@link Thread#interrupted()}.
 *
 * By definition, any @CancelableServerCall is interruptible.  We use this Interruptible annotation for cancelable
 * calls that are not necessarily server calls.

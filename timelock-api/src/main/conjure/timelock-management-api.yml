    endpoints:
      getNamespaces:
        http: POST /getNamespaces
        returns: set<string>
        docs: |
          The endpoint loads all persisted namespaces. ``leaderPaxos`` is filtered out from the set
          as it is not a namespace.

      achieveConsensus:
        http: POST /achieveConsensus
        args:
          namespaces: set<string>
        docs: |
          The operation of achieving consensus on all namespaces is NOT atomic. In the case of failures, it can
          be assumed that consensus was achieved on some namespaces.

      invalidateResources:
        http: POST /invalidateResources
        args:
          namespaces: set<string>
        docs: |
          Invalidates existing resources for a given TimeLock namespace in a persistant way, until re-enabled. Does not
          actually cause a leader election, and should not interrupt service for other naemspaces. Note that this
          operation is atomic for each namespace (e.g. users will not see two different lock services servicing the
          same startTransactions request), but not atomic as a whole. Additionally, if this method throws, it is
          nondeterministic which, if any, namespaces have been invalidated; some may even be invalidated only on a
          subset od nodes. This state can be cleared by re-enabling all namespaces.

      disableTimelock:
        http: POST /disable
        args:
          request: set<api.Namespace>
        returns: DisableNamespacesResponse
        docs: |
          Disables the TimeLock server in a persistant way for the specified namespaces. This includes invalidating
          all currently held locks, all lock watch state, as well as refusing to serve new requests.
      reenableTimelock:
        http: POST /reenable
        args:
          request: ReenableNamespacesRequest
        returns: ReenableNamespacesResponse
        docs: |
          Allows the TimeLock server to once again serve requests for these namespaces.

      getServerLifecycleId:
        http: POST /getServerLifecycleId
        returns: uuid
        docs: |
          Gets the randomly generated server id associated with the server's current lifecycle upon start up.

      forceKillTimeLockServer:
        http: POST /forceKillTimeLockServer
        returns: uuid
        docs: |
          Kills TimeLock server asynchronously i.e. current server will not be able to talk to
          peer nodes or serve requests once the task is executed. After hitting this endpoint, the server will require
          external intervention to start up the service again. The endpoint returns the (randomly generated) server id
          associated with server upon start up. A client can then make `getServerId` requests wherein change in
          server id would imply that the server was bounced.

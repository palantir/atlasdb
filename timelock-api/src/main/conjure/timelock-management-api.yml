    name: TimeLock Management Service
    default-auth: header
    package: com.palantir.atlasdb.timelock.api.management
    base-path: /tl/management
    endpoints:
      getNamespaces:
        http: POST /getNamespaces
        returns: set<string>
        docs: |
          The endpoint loads all persisted namespaces. ``leaderPaxos`` is filtered out from the set
          as it is not a namespace.

      achieveConsensus:
        http: POST /achieveConsensus
        args:
          namespaces: set<string>
        docs: |
          The operation of achieving consensus on all namespaces is NOT atomic. In the case of failures, it can
          be assumed that consensus was achieved on some namespaces.

      invalidateResources:
        http: POST /invalidateResources
        args:
          namespaces: set<string>
        docs: |
          Invalidates existing resources for a given TimeLock namespace. Does not actually cause a leader election, and
          should not interrupt service for other naemspaces. Note that this operation is atomic for each namespace (e.g.
          users will not see two different lock services servicing the same startTransactions request), but not atomic
          as a whole.

      getServerId:
        http: POST /getServerId
        returns: uuid
        docs: |
          Gets the randomly generated server id associated with the server's current lifecycle upon start up.

      forceKillTimeLockServer:
        http: POST /forceKillTimeLockServer
        returns: uuid
        docs: |
          Kills TimeLock server asynchronously i.e. current server will not be able to talk to
          peer nodes or serve requests once the task is executed. After hitting this endpoint, the server will require
          external intervention to start up the service again. The endpoint returns the (randomly generated) server id
          associated with server upon start up. A client can then make `getServerId` requests wherein change in
          server id would imply that the server was bounced.

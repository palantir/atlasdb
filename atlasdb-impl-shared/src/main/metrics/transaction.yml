namespaces:
  transaction:
    shortName: Transaction
    docs: Metrics for tracking information around transactions, such as success rate.
    metrics:
      outcome:
        type: meter
        docs: The number of transactions that completed, classified as a `success` or `failure`, with `outcome` representing more granular explanations for each classification. Note that in rare cases, a transaction may complete but not record its outcome.
        tags:
          - name: category
            docs: Records whether the transaction succeeded (`success`) or failed (`fail`). If a new outcome is added without a mapping to a category, the value will be `unknown`.
            values: [success, fail, unknown]
          - name: outcome
            docs: The granular outcome that led to the transaction succeeding or failing. See the TransactionOutcome enum for more details
          - name: tableReference
            docs: |
              The table reference, if the outcome relates to a given table (e.g., a conflict), and the table reference is safe to log.
              If the outcome relates to a given table but the table reference is not safe to log, the value will be `{table}`
              If the outcome does not relate to a given table, the value will be the empty string.

      rolledBackOtherTransaction:
        type: meter
        docs: | 
          The number of times a transaction has rolled back another transaction (for example, if we read a value from a transaction
          that started before our start timestamp and hasn't committed). This will be logged at most once for a given
          transaction being rolled back, even if multiple transactions aim to rollback the same transaction.

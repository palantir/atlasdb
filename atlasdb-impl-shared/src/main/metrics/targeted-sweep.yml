      closedBucketIdentifier:
        type: gauge
        docs: The bucket identifier that was associated with the last closed bucket.
      bucketAssignerStatus:
        type: gauge
        docs: | 
          The result of the bucket assigner's last run as an integer.
          0. INCOMPLETE
          1. CLOSED
          2. CONTENTION_ON_WRITES
          
          INCOMPLETE represents the fact that the bucket assigner ran but
          could not close the bucket. CLOSED represents the fact that the bucket assigner closed the bucket.
          CONTENTION_ON_WRITES is when the bucket assigner may be racing against another bucket assigner on a different
          node and failed to complete.
          A healthy state is when the bucket assigner is running regularly (emitting an INCOMPLETE status), and periodically emitting a CLOSED status.
      completedMaxBucketsForSingleBucketAssignerIteration:
        type: meter
        docs: |
          Incremented when a bucket assigner creates the max allowed buckets in a single run. This implies that the 
          bucket assigner is quite far behind. If this metric is incremented too frequently, this may imply a bug in the
          state machine preventing the bucket assigner from making forward progress.
      bucketAssignerState:
        type: gauge
        docs: |
            The state of the bucket assigner, represented as an integer:
            0. START
            1. OPENING
            2. WAITING_UNTIL_CLOSEABLE
            3. CLOSING_FROM_OPEN

      abortedWritesDeleted:
        type: gauge
        tags:
          - strategy
        docs: >-
          Number of values in the key-value-service that were deleted by targeted sweep threads, because they
          corresponded to transactions that did not successfully commit.
      sweepTimestamp:
        type: gauge
        tags:
          - strategy
        docs: Value of the sweep timestamp (that is, the highest timestamp that is eligible for sweeping).
      lastSweptTimestamp:
        type: gauge
        tags:
          - strategy
        docs: Value of the last swept timestamp (that is, the highest timestamp at which we actually did sweep).
      lastSeenCommitTs:
        type: gauge
        docs: Value of the last seen commit timestamp across shards (this metric is not recorded for thorough strategy).
      millisSinceLastSweptTs:

        docs: >-
          Estimate in milliseconds of how old the last swept timestamp is. This gives an estimate of when the oldest
          entries in the sweep queue were written.

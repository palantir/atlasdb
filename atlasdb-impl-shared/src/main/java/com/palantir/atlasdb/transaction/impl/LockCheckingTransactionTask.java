/**
 *  Best effort attempt to keep backwards compatibility while making immutableTs lock validation optional on reads.
 *  <p>
 *  If a read is performed without validating immutableTs lock on a thoroughly swept table, there is no guarantee on
 *  consistency of data read; as sweep may remove data that is being read. This will not cause any correctness
 *  issues as immutableTs lock will be checked on commit time, and transaction will be aborted if lock is invalid.
 *  Although this prevents committing corrupted values, reading inconsistent data may cause tasks to throw
 *  non-retriable exceptions; causing a possible behaviour change.
 *  <p>
 *  This wrapper task will convert the exception thrown by the underlying task into a retriable lock timeout exception
 *  if immutableTs lock is not valid anymore.

What is AtlasDB?
================

AtlasDB is a transaction layer built on top of any generic key value
store. Relational databases are good at OLTP (many small transactions)
style queries and OLAP (ad-hoc large queries). AtlasDB doubles down on
the OLTP style workflows at the expense of OLAP. Queries are very
explicit and query time can easily be back of the enveloped.

/**
 * Reads state of a {@link com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.api.KeyValueService} in accordance with the provided
 * AtlasDB timestamp, following the AtlasDB read protocol. This includes reading the most recent committed value for
 * each cell that would be visible at the provided timestamp(s) and filtering out versions that have been aborted or
 * not committed yet.
 * <p>
 * If used in the context of a transaction, users are responsible for validating that snapshots read are still
 * guaranteed to be consistent (for example, transactions may need to validate their pre-commit conditions or check
 * that sweep has not progressed). Some methods may have partial, intermediate validation required as part of servicing
 * a read; this class will carry out this intermediate validation.
 * <p>
 * Although this interface performs user-level reads, internal writes may be performed (for example, as part of the
 * read protocol, to abort a long-running transaction).

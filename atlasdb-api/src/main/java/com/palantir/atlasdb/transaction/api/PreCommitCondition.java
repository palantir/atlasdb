/**
 * General condition that is checked before a transaction commits for validity. All conditions associated with a
 * transaction must be true for that transaction to commit successfully. If a given condition is valid at commit
 * time, it must also be true that it was valid throughout the lifetime of the transaction. This is not explicitly
 * checked, so care must be taken in designing appropriate conditions that satisfy this constraint.
 *
 * As an example, advisory locks are a common pre-commit condition and one that is built into the
 * {@link TransactionManager} API. These locks are granted before the transaction starts and cannot be refreshed
 * once they lapse, so they provide the necessary invariant. If they are valid at commit time, they were valid
 * for the entire lifetime of the transaction.
 *
 * Conditions are associated with a transaction, but should not interfere with the transaction locks (non-advisory)
 * used by the transaction. The validity of those locks is controlled separately from any pre-commit conditions, and
 * they follow different constraints - transaction locks are only acquired at commit time, for example, rather than
 * at the beginning of a transaction.

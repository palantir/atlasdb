/**
 * Curious creature, but it allows the user to delay deciding the particular cell to write to until the actual commit,
 * at which point the user will be provided with a unique long value that can be used to generate the cell.
 *
 * This is a very specific feature that not many people probably require, or should try to use.
 *
 * Right now the interface allows you to do TOO MUCH, you don't even have to specify the tables you write to.
 * This can be improved and locked down, but this allows for maximum experimentation.

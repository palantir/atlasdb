/**
 * Provides the methods for a transaction with the key-value store.
 *
 * In general: users may assume that if maps (including sorted maps) keyed on byte[] are returned to the user,
 * they may be accessed via any byte array that is equivalent in terms of
 * {@link java.util.Arrays#equals(byte[], byte[])}.
 *
 * Throughout this class, methods that return structures that may not perform all of their loading upfront (batching
 * visitables, iterables, streams and futures, for instance) _must_ be used strictly within the scope of the
 * transaction. Concretely, this means that results must be retrieved before exiting the transaction - in the case of
 * streams and iterators, this means that you must collect the results before exiting; in the case of futures, you must
 * await all asynchronous calls before returning from the transaction.

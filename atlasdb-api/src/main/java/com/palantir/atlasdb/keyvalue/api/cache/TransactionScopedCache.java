/**
 * The {@link LockWatchValueScopingCache} will provide one of these to every (relevant) transaction, and this will
 * contain a view of the cache at the correct point in time, which is determined by the transaction's
 * {@link com.palantir.lock.watch.LockWatchVersion}.
 *
 * The semantics of this cache are as follows:
 *  1. Writes in the transaction will invalidate values in this local cache (but *not* in the central cache, as the
 *     lock events will take care of that);
 *  2. Reads will first try to read a value from the cache; if not present, it will be loaded remotely and cached
 *     locally.
 *  3. At commit time, all remote reads will be flushed to the central cache (and these reads will be filtered based on
 *     the lock events that have happened since the transaction was started).
 *
 * It is safe to perform these reads due to the transaction semantics: for a serialisable transaction, we will use
 * the locked descriptors at commit time to validate whether we have read-write conflicts; otherwise, reading the
 * values in the cache is just as safe as reading a snapshot of the database taken at the start timestamp.

/**
 * The idea here is to keep a map of {@link com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.api.CellReference} -> value for each table.
 * Applying lock watch events will:
 *  - for {@link com.palantir.lock.watch.LockEvent}, denote that the given descriptor cannot be cached;
 *  - for {@link com.palantir.lock.watch.UnlockEvent}, denote that the given descriptor can now be cached;
 *  - for {@link com.palantir.lock.watch.LockWatchCreatedEvent}, denote that the given table can now be cached;
 *
 * The central mapping is kept up-to-date with the above, but views of the map are given to transactions which are
 * accurate at the start timestamp's lock watch version. Each transaction then can read from the cache as well as
 * create a digest of values that it has read (and is allowed to read). At commit time, it will flush those values to
 * the central cache (taking in to account the since-locked descriptors), as well as checking for conflicts for
 * serializable transactions by adding a check in the {@link com.palantir.atlasdb.transaction.api.PreCommitCondition}.

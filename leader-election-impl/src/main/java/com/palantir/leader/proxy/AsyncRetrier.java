    Threading model: Given the context of this class, it is likely that the first request will pass. Since this occurs
    in the hot path, we should probably avoid putting it on another thread to do what would be light work as we will
    pay for that in context switches.

    In a similar vein to reduce context switches, when the supplier::get call returns, the processing should be fairly
    lightweight, so we should be able to do it in whatever thread ran/took control of the original supplier::get call,
    hence the usage of directExecutor.

    If we do have to retry, then we're likely "slow" enough that we should give up the initial calling thread and
    offload the work onto a separate executor.

  description: |-
    Four small metrics cuts:
    - Only log the background sweep batch multiplier if <1.
    - Don't instrument `TimestampManagementService` endpoints (used only in timelock migration): saves 10 series.
    - Don't instrument `CoordinationService` endpoints (used only in transactions2 migration): saves 10 series.
    - Don't publish `timelockSuccessfulRequest` and `timelockFailedRequest`: saves 4 series.

    Please contact the AtlasDB team if the removal of these series will be an issue.

fix:
  description: RPC calls to TimeLock via Conjure now correctly block for either a
    short (10s) or long (60s) duration depending on what the call does. Previously,
    these were swapped, which manifested as lock requests on contended locks aborting
    from the client side after 10 seconds even though they could be served.

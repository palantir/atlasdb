    Fix Ec2HostLocationSupplier using a different format to Cassandra

    **Goals (and why)**:
    Modify Ec2HostLocationSupplier to emulate Cassandra's Ec2Snitch logic (as it is later comparing against parsed info from that class).

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:
    The response string from the AWS endpoint is now parsed using code copied from Cassandra's implementation (or as close as possible)

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:
    Added a test to make sure that the parsing gives the expected result

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**:
    Today

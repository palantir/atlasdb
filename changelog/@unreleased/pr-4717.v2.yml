  description: "Conjure Java Runtime is upgraded to 5.7.0. \n\nServers which still
    run using jdk8 and do not use an external implementation (e.g. Conscrypt) are
    expected to incur a performance penalty due to a software GCM implementation and
    are recommended to upgrade as soon as possible."

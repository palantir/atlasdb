  description: 'AtlasDB now publishes all of its metrics with `metricOrigin: atlasdb`.
    _This also means that AtlasDB publishes all metrics as tagged metrics: this may
    break users that have workflows that involve reading values directly from a `MetricRegistry`.
    The same metric will be published in the `TaggedMetricRegistry` that users would
    have provided to AtlasDB._'

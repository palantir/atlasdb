  description: '`PollingRefreshable`s now support value transformations. Consequently,
    they now use two type parameters. If you had a `PollingRefreshable<T>`, it now
    needs to be changed to `PollingRefreshable<T, T>`. The old factory method remains
    and will apply the identity transformation for you.'

fix:
  description: We now handle blacklisting and un-blacklisting of Cassandra nodes correctly
    when the nodes in the cluster have changed underneath us. Previously, when attempting
    to un-blacklist a node that was no longer part of the cluster, we would encounter
    a `NullPointerException`.

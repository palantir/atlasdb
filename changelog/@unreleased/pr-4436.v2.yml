    PTExecutors does not propagate state to recurring tasks

    Previously both tracing and ExecutorInheritableThreadLocal state
    were retained by recurring tasks, which lead to background activity
    referencing state from when a task is first scheduled. There are
    several places where we lazily start scheduled background tasks,
    this inadvertently attributes background work to the first user
    to exercise the codepath.

  description: |-
    Allow specification of an SQLExceptionOverride handler to Hikari, and don't treat SQLTimeoutException an evictable for Oracle
      by default (as wass the case pre Hikari-3.2.0).
    Allow empty testQuery (and use Connection.isValid() in that case). Oracle will now use isValid() by default.
    Allow control of whether connections are re-tested before being handed out from connection pool. Default remains true.

  description: |-
    Allow dropping tables when not writing to the sweep queue

    **Goals (and why)**:
    If we never created the TS tables, attempting to drop a table would throw an IllegalStateException since we try to persist information about the drop into the clearer table.

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:
    Always create the clearer table, even if we do not write to the sweep queue. Do not nevesarrily create the other tables from the TS schema.

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:
    Test that was failing on develop, now passes

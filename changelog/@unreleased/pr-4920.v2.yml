  description: AtlasDB now publishes only the counter metrics for the top 10 tables
    by delta relative to the last measurement for `SnapshotTransaction` (`cellsRead,
    cellsReturned, emptyValue, invalidStartTs, invalidCommitTs, commitTsGreaterThanTransactionTs`).
    This should detect spikes as well as by default track the busiest tables, while
    making savings on metrics cost.

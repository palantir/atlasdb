fix:
  description: We no longer read and store streams lazily in the Atlas stream store.
    This fixes a bug where users who stored and marked streams in a single transaction
    and subsequently referenced the returned `Sha256Hash` may throw when storing streams,
    and/or suffer from data corruption.

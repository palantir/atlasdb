fix:
  description: "We no longer read and physically store streams lazily in the AtlasDB
    store when transactionally storing a stream (via `storeStreams()`). \n\nPreviously,
    users who stored and marked streams in a single transaction and subsequently referenced
    the returned `Sha256Hash` may fail in the following ways:\n\n- if the provided
    `InputStream`s throw when they are read after being closed, these exceptions would
    be thrown out to the user.\n- if the provided `InputStream`s do not throw when
    they are read after being closed, AtlasDB would erroneously write an empty block
    as the first block of the stream, and incorrect metadata of the stream being a
    1-block empty stream."

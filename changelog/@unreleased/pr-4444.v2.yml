fix:
  description: We no longer read and physically store streams lazily in the Atlas
    stream store when `storeStreams()` is called. This fixes a bug where users who
    stored and marked streams in a single transaction and subsequently referenced
    the returned `Sha256Hash` may throw when storing streams, and/or suffer from data
    corruption.

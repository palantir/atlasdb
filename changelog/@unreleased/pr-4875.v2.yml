    Remove duplicate metrics from TimelockAgent.createSharedExecutor. Removes the untagged variants of instrumentation, but leaves the tagged executor and thread-factory instrumentation provided by PTExecutors.
    The tagged metrics are useful more broadly because they can be used with general purpose dashboards and alerts.

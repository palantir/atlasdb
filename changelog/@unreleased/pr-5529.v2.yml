  description: Autobatchers that interact with Cassandra or TimeLock are now resilient
    to cases where operations hang (defined as taking more than 5 minutes or 30 seconds
    respectively). In these cases, if a request takes longer than the stipulated amount
    of time, the batch will be marked as failed (but users will see these failures
    and can retry - e.g. transactions with runTaskWithRetry will retry).

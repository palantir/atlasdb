fix:
  description: Nodes presenting a plausible evolution of the previously agreed cluster topology can now be accepted
    during a `NO_QUORUM` state, even if there is no overall quorum among new nodes. Previously, a quorum among the
    new nodes was required which was unnecessarily restrictive.

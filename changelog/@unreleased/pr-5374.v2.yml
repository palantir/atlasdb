    fix dbkvs runtime config

    **Goals (and why)**: Accidentally did not set a jackson type name for the new dbkvs runtime config, which means that it relied on using the class name instead of the logical name ("relational").

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**: Add missing jackson annotation.

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:

    **Concerns (what feedback would you like?)**:

    **Where should we start reviewing?**:

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**: normal

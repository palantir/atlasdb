  description: 'Cassandra client pool improvement: in the event there is no quorum,
    we check the new nodes for their perspective of what the cluster should look like.
    If new nodes are in agreement and their agreement matches the agreed-upon host
    IDs that the old nodes agreed on, we consider them to be consistent. This allows
    for handling of cases where the Cassandra cluster changes the IPs of all nodes
    between bounces.'

feature:
  description: "AtlasDB now allows Dialogue to be enabled when communicating with
    TimeLock. \n\nImportantly, note that this is limited to AtlasDB's communication
    with TimeLock - internode communication between TimeLock nodes, or services using
    leader blocks or remote timestamp and lock services, still takes place over Conjure-Java-Runtime.
    Furthermore, AtlasDB currently will not share its client pools or Dialogue factories
    with its users.\n\nThis feature is in **beta** and APIs are unlikely to be stable
    at this time: please talk to the AtlasDB team should you wish to use this feature
    in production."

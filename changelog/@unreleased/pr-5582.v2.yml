  description: |-
    Cassandra tracing config is now part of runtime config instead of a separate file.
    No behavior has changed however the way you configure this has changed. See the
    docs for details.
    
    This also includes a performance improvement since it will no longer create a
    background thread that attempts to read a file every minute.

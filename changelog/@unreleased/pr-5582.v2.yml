    remove background thread for tracing conf

    **Goals (and why)**:

    Currently all services that use atlas have a background thread which every minute checks on disk for a file for tracing prefs that only actually apply to cassandra. This moves this config to the actual KVS runtime config and removes this background thread entirely.

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**: Remove unnecessary background thread and create an equivalent config structure in the cassandra kvs runtime config.

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**: N/A

    **Concerns (what feedback would you like?)**: N/A

    **Where should we start reviewing?**: N/A

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**: normal

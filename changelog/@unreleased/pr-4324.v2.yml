    Added a new metric `com.palantir.common.proxy.ExperimentRunningProxy.experimentErrors` that counts the number of errors
    encountered by all clients created using `VersionSelectingClients.createVersionSelectingClient`, i.e., errors occuring
    while using the experimental CJR AtlasDB client.

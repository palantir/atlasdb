  description: '`enableDialogue` is no longer configurable: Dialogue is sufficiently
    stable that we believe forcing it for all TimeLock users is acceptable. We believe
    that this configuration option has not ever been used in production. Please contact
    the AtlasDB team if this is a concern.'

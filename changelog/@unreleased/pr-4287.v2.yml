improvement:
  description: Improved tracking of the unreadable timestamp, and thus accuracy of
    Sweep and timestamp metrics, on stacks where reads are sparse. The `AsyncPuncher`
    now grabs a fresh timestamp when punching if there were no explicit punches since
    the last time the underlying puncher was invoked.

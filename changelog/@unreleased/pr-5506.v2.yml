improvement:
  description: When priority tables are specified for background sweep, it will now
    sweep *only* these tables. Previously, it begins one iteration of sweep for another
    table, realises it shouldn't continue, and then begins one iteration for another
    table and so on, ad infinitum.  This behaviour does not make sense, and furthermore
    could mean that we can't "make background sweep run ONLY on table xyz", because
    it might select other tables that are eligible in a larger deployment or if there
    are more threads.

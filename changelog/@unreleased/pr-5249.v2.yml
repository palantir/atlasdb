    allow defining cassandra server hosts in runtime config

    **Goals (and why)**:
    Because cassandra server hosts can dynamically change, we should allow defining them in runtime config.

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:
    * If there are more than 1 host defined in the install config, we prefer that over runtime (to not break backcompat)

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:
    * unit tested

    **Concerns (what feedback would you like?)**:

    **Where should we start reviewing?**:

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**:
    today (many recent tickets/paging)

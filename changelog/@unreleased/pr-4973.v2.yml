  description: |-
    Targeted sweep runtime configuration now has a `enableAutoTuning` parameter. While true, targeted sweep will dynamically adjust the pause between sweep iterations based on the amount of work that was done. It will, furthermore, attempt to read a full batch (100k) of entries to sweep whenever possible.

    The `batchShardIterations` parameter has been deprecated and now does nothing, use `maximumPartitionsToBatchInSingleRead` or `enableAutoTuning` instead.

  description: Fixed a regression that caused targeted sweep to always run with only
    a single thread per strategy. As a consequence, targeted sweep auto scaling only
    affects the pause between iterations and has no bearing on the number of parallel
    tasks. Added a metric `targetedSweepProgress.sweepDelay` that tracks the latest
    delay per strategy in milliseconds.

improvement:
  description: AtlasDB generated code now optimises getRanges and getRangesLazy to
  select only required columns. This is known to improve performance for single-column
  tables (Nathan's optimization). This does not affect dynamic column tables.

  AtlasDB users that check in their schemas need to regenerate them to benefit from this improvement.

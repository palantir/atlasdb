improvement:
  description: Users may now explicitly override the `namespace` of an Oracle connection
    configuration, which is usually the mechanism by which an individual AtlasDB user
    identifies itself (e.g. to timelock and possibly to the underlying key-value-service).
    This was previously automatically assumed to be the `sid` of the Oracle database;
    however, that is not actually the way an individual AtlasDB user identifies itself.

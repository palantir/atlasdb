improvement:
  description: Users may now explicitly override the `namespace` of a DB key value
    service configuration, which is usually the mechanism by which an individual AtlasDB
    user identifies itself (e.g. to timelock and possibly to the underlying key-value-service).
    This was previously automatically assumed to be the `sid` of the Oracle database
    or `dbname` of the Postgres database; however, that is not actually the way an
    individual AtlasDB user identifies itself in practice.

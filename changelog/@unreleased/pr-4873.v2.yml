    Some Cassandra client pool metrics have been removed, to save costs:
    - `approximatePoolSize`: please use `numIdle + numActive` instead.
    - `proportionDestroyedByEvictor`: please use `destroyedByEvictor / created` instead.
    - `destroyedByBorrower` and `proportionDestroyedByBorrower`: these have been 0 everywhere in production for the past year, because we do not do any validation on objects returned from the pool (at least, within the object pooling framework).

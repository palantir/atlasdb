improvement:
  description: |-
    reduce log level.

    **Goals (and why)**:
    Internal PDS-138463

    This can happen during a timelock leader election, and retrying transaction should work.
    The log level can be misleading, hence reducing the level to warn.

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:
    fairly trivial

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:
    none, but again, fairly trivial

    **Concerns (what feedback would you like?)**:
    none

    **Where should we start reviewing?**:

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**:

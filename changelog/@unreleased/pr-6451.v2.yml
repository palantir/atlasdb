    While reviewing JFR from some high volume AtlasDB client services (think mountains), I noticed they spend a significant amount of time verifying that the Cassandra ports are the same in
    `com.palantir.atlasdb.keyvalue.cassandra.pool.CassandraService.getKnownPort():300`.

    We can optimize this for the happy path where the port is known and consistent for a ~10x improvement.

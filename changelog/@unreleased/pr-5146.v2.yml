fix:
  description: Calling registerWatches now tells the lockWatchManager to _only_ watch
    those watches, instead of adding it to the set of all registered watches so far.
    Note that this does not affect Timelock (which will still contain all watches
    registered so far), but rolling Timelock will mean that the LockWatchManager now
    only re-registers the latest requested watches.

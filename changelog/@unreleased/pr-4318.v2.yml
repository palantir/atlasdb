improvement:
  description: Our Conjure-Java-Runtime client is now more resilient to transient
    failures or rolling upgrades of TimeLock Server. Previously, we would give up
    after an expected 1.5 seconds of being unable to contact TimeLock; we now try
    for an expected 10 seconds. Feign client users are unaffected.

    Explicit do delegate annotation

    [Reference Issue](https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/issues/4411)

    **Goals**:
    - Fail on generating an AutoDelegate implementation if there are any default methods that have not been annotated with either @DoNotDelegate or @DoDelegate
    - Do not autoDelegate CassandraKeyValueServiceConfig

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:
    - Validation check is added (validateMethodsToBeAutoDelegated) in the AutoDelegateProcessor.
    - It enforces decision on whether a default method should be autoDelegated or not.
    - In case where a default method is not explicitly annotated, autoDelegation for the interface fails.

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:
    Work in progress.

    **Where should we start reviewing?**:
    AutoDelegateProcessor

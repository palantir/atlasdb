    There are some situations that can result in cached table lookups returning the wrong table for a table which has been dropped and re-created.

    There are different scenarios where the caching breaks down, see the tests in TableRemappingKeyValueServiceTest for details.

    This change is the first in what may become a series to resolve the concurrency issues within KvTableMappingService.

    Unfortunately this change isn't actually sufficient to solve the table caching issues, however the feature to disable the table cache added in https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/6946 should allow for correctness where we expect namespaced tables to be created and deleted at a reasonably high scale.

    The long-term fix for this problem is likely to either remove the cache from KvTableMappingService completely, or to re-write KvTableMappingService to be multi-node safe. As it stands, KvTableMappingService is NOT concurrency safe.

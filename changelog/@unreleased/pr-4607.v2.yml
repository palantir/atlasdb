    SweepStrategyManagers only load one table metadata on cache miss

    **Goals (and why)**:

    Do not have to reload all tables' metadata (which could include a LOT of tables) every single time there is a cache miss.

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:

    Rather than have a supplier that recalculates the entire map each time, just get and cache each entry. But still add all initial tables at the beginning as a perf optimization.

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:

    **Concerns (what feedback would you like?)**:

    **Where should we start reviewing?**:

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**:

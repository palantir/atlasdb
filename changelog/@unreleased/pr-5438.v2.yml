  description: 'AtlasDB now by default releases the locks of transactions that are spending more than 5 minutes committing (note: this does not mean that an AtlasDB _transaction_ is bounded by 5 minutes, only the parts of the protocol during which the transaction locks need to be held) to allow forward progress. If this is a problem, consider configuring `transaction.commitLockTenure` in runtime config.'

fix:
  description: The cluster topology stored in CassandraTopologyValidator is updated
    when nodes are accepted during a `NO_QUORUM` state. Previously, this was not stored,
    meaning that logging arguments e.g. `serversInConsensus` were inaccurate, and
    also changes from one set of host IDs to another disjoint set _that went through
    a sequence of intermediate plausible evolutions_ were incorrectly rejected.

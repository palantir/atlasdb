fix:
  description: The `BlockEnforcingLockService` now handles `LockRequest`s and `WaitForLocksRequest`s with timeouts
    of zero correctly. Previously, we would throw a `NullPointerException` on these requests.
    You should only be affected if you are using the v2 `LockService` directly, as AtlasDB does not, as part of its
    transactions, create requests with zero timeouts unless `getLockAcquireTimeoutMillis` is explicitly configured
    as such.

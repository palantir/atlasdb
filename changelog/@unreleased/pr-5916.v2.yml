  description: Cassandra connections are no longer removed from the pool as soon as
    they are no longer present in the token range; instead, they are only removed
    if they are absent from N consecutive token range refreshes, where N is a configurable
    value in `CassandraKeyValueServiceConfig`. This is expected to make the most difference
    when the hosts are changing frequently.

  description: Added functionality to accept staging reads on transactions3 if `internalSchema.acceptStagingReadsOnVersionThreeDangerousIKnowWhatIAmDoing`
    in runtime config is set to true. This should NEVER be used without a good reason,
    but makes sense at internal shopping product where the volume of reads is too
    high.

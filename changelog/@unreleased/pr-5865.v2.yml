improvement:
  description: The host location supplier is now run in a separate thread, and will
    return empty while evaluating. This is particularly important when the `Ec2HostLocationSupplier`
    repeatedly (and slowly) fails to connect, as this is on the creation path of the
    `CassandraClientPoolImpl` and thus the transaction manager creation path.

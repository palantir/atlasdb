fix:
  description: '`AutoDelegate` implementations of `TimelockService` now delegate `isInitialized`
    and `tryUnlock` correctly. Previously, they would call the default methods - this
    manifested as AtlasDB clients making synchronous calls to TimeLock when unlocking
    things at the end of a transaction, as opposed to using an autobatcher to asynchronously
    do these.'

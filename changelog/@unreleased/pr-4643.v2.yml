improvement:
  description: Clients for Paxos resources will detect failure more quickly when making
    remote calls to Paxos endpoints, as there is little reason to believe these requests
    will complete successfully if they are taking a long time. This may reduce or
    slow down thread pool saturation when a TimeLock node is unhealthy.

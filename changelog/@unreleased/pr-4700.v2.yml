fix:
  description: TimeLock rolling bounces should be more stable - previously if there
    were a number of inflight requests at the time of the rolling bounce there would
    be an outage owing to thread saturation on a thread pool. We have relaxed the
    bounds on that pool; metrics for the pool's size should continue to be monitored.

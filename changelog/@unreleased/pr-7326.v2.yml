    - Bump for gradle-baseline-java
    - Fixed the ClassInitializationDeadlock error caused by the gradle-baseline-java version bump. The fix uses an anonymous class interface, which will delay the instantiation until required, and therefore reducing the risk of a jvm loop leading to ClassInitializationDeadlock.

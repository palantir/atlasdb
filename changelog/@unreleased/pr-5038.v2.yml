    make oracle protocol case insensitive

    **Goals (and why)**:

    Makes the protocol (tcp/tcps) case insensitive in oracle configs.
    Previously oracle connection configs required the protocol to be
    upper-case. Most of our other internal products allow any case
    on the oracle protocol, so the requirement here for it to be
    upper-case in config results in some errors when people try to
    configure oracle.

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:

    Adds jackson annotations to the ConnectionProtocol enum.

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:

    Added a unit test.

    **Concerns (what feedback would you like?)**: N/A

    **Where should we start reviewing?**: N/A

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**: high - allowing this to be case insensitive avoids configuration errors and helps with interoperability with other products that don't enforce case sensitivity on the oracle protocol.

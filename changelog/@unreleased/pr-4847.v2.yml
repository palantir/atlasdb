  description: 'AtlasDB now publishes Targeted Sweep metrics for a given strategy only after it is deemed to be
    active: that is, if 1000 cells have been written, 1000 cells have been read, or if Targeted Sweep is believed to
    be 4 hours behind. This should ease metric loads for users that only use CONSERVATIVE or THOROUGH tables,
    especially if they run multiple TransactionManagers.'

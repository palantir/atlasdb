improvement:
  description: AtlasDB now allows users to pass in a `DialogueClients.ReloadingFactory`
    in install configuration. This is likely to be useful for AtlasDB-Proxy, which
    wishes to share its Dialogue connection pools across `TransactionManager`s. If
    not provided, AtlasDB will create its own factory.

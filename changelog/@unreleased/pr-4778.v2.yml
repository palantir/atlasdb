improvement:
  description: AtlasDB now allows users to pass in a `DialogueClients.ReloadingFactory`
    in install configuration. This is likely to be useful for multitenant users of
    AtlasDB who wish to share their Dialogue connection pools across `TransactionManager`s.
    If not provided, AtlasDB will create its own factory.

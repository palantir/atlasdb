fix:
  description: Serializable transactions no longer read from `commitTimestamp + 1`
    when performing read-write conflict checking. Previously, they may have done so,
    which runs a data corruption risk where an ABA conflict may be obscured. Note
    that this risk is extremely small (owing to this requiring a very specific interleaving
    of execution, _transactions2, and in _most_ cases serializability still being
    preserved even though the strict serializability AtlasDB normally offers may not
    be).

  description: '`AuxiliaryRemotingParameters#shouldSupportBlockingOperations` is now
    changed to `AuxiliaryRemotingParameters#shouldUseExtendedTimeout`. This is done
    to avoid confusion with Dialogue generated code where blocking indicates that
    client requests should wait till competion. You should only be affected if you
    provide these parameters and construct HTTP clients through AtlasDbHttpClients
    directly.'

fix:
  description: Lock Watches no longer generate client updates instructing users to
    clear their caches after a snapshot if they indicate that their last known version
    _is_ the version of the snapshot, provided that AtlasDB has seen a success since.
    Previously, whenever a snapshot was taken, we would insist that clients always
    clear their cache while no actual lock/unlock/creation event happened.

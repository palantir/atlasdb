fix:
  description: Lock Watches no longer generate client updates instructing users to
    clear their caches after a snapshot if they indicate that their last known version
    _is_ the version of the snapshot. Previously, whenever a snapshot was taken, we
    would insist that clients always clear their cache, even after they have demonstrated
    that they knew about the snapshot.

fix:
  description: "We no longer read and physically store streams lazily in the AtlasDB
    store when transactionally storing a stream (via `storeStreams()`). \n\nPreviously,
    users who stored and marked streams in a single transaction and subsequently referenced
    the returned `Sha256Hash` may fail in the following ways:\n\n- if the provided
    `InputStream`s throw when they are read after being closed, these exceptions would
    be thrown out to the user.\n- if the provided `InputStream`s do not throw when
    they are read after being closed, AtlasDB would erroneously write an empty block
    as the first block of the stream, and incorrect metadata of the stream being an
    empty stream."

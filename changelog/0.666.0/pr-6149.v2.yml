    TimeLock exposes three new endpoints:
    - getFreshTimestamp, returns one fresh timestamp which is just a number, i.e. `1234567890`.
    - getFreshTimestampsV2, returns a range of timestamps in a more efficient encoding: ``{"start": 1234567890, "count": 5}`.
    - getCommitTimestamp, returns just a timestamp as opposed to a start/inclusive pair along with the lock watch state update, if relevant.

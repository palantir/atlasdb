feature:
  description: '`SweepPriorityOverrideConfig` now has a `runLeakySweepOnThoroughTables`
    property which, if set, will cause iterations of legacy sweep on thorough tables
    to not sweep ~1% of entries. This is highly recommended for sweeping tables that
    switched from conservative to thorough and may have a large number of sweep sentinels.'

improvement:
  description: AtlasDB now allows users to pass in a `DialogueClients.ReloadingFactory`
    to the builder of `TransactionManagers`. This is likely to be useful for AtlasDB-Proxy,
    which wishes to share its Dialogue connection pools across `TransactionManager`s.
    If not provided, AtlasDB will create its own factory.

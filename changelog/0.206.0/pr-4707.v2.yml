    PTExecutors thread factory uses daemon threads by default. Most consumers prefer daemon threads to avoid propping up JVMs that want to die.
    PTExecutors.newCachedThreadPool returns ExecutorService instances instead of ThreadPoolExecutor concrete types. This is an ABI break. Please use WC executor factories!
    PTExecutors (and all executors using NamedThreadFactory) report metrics into the singleton TaggedMetricRegistry.

fix:
  description: '`validateObject()` no longer throws when Cassandra becomes or is unreachable.
    This avoids a resource leak that could corrupt the Cassandra client pool''s internal
    state-machine, which previously manifested as increased GC and CPU as the pool
    code ran a tight loop that allocated an iterator.'

fix:
  description: We now handle Cassandra upscales and decommissions more smoothly. Previously
    we only kept track of the last consistent topology and treated topologies that
    are different in any way as distinct, so these cluster changes would be treated
    as dissent/possible split brain, which is unnecessarily disruptive.

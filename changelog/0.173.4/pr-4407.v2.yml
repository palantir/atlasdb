improvement:
  description: Under certain circumstances, clients will fail to recognise a new timelock
    leader until the old leader has rebooted/is available. This would lead to unavailability
    for the duration of the reboot, or an outage if the old leader stays unreachable.
    We now randomise the next timelock host for a client to try instead of a fixed
    host.

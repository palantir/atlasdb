fix:
  description: We no longer create a `FastFailoverProxy` when creating a single node
    proxy. Previously, if this was created when talking to an individual TimeLock
    node that was not the leader (or a service that would otherwise return `308`s),
    we would spin for about 10 seconds before returning. Users of failover proxies
    to TimeLock (e.g. if using the timestamp or lock services from a `TransactionManager`)
    are unaffected.

fix:
  description: Timelock now verifies consistency of the file based paxos state log
    with SQLite and fails to start if the check fails. It was previously possible
    to migrate to SQLite, force a downgrade and use file based log, then upgrade again
    and skip running the migration again without detecting the inconsistent state.

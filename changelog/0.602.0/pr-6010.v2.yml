  description: "`CassandraClientFactory` now uses a narrowed `CassandraKeyValueServiceConfig`
    called `CassandraClientConfig`. \n\nAs a result of `keyspace` now being required
    for construction, both `CassandraService` and `CassandraClientFactory` now throw
    at construction if `keyspace` is not present. \n\nPreviously, `CassandraService`
    would throw if `keyspace` is missing but `servers` is not empty, and `CassandraClientFactory`
    would throw on each call of `create` if `keyspace` is missing."

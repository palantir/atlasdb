  description: 'An additional config `allSafeForLogging` is now added during TransactionManager creation time.
    If all the initialized transaction managers all have this `allSafeForLogging` field set to true, all the
    tableReferences, columnNames and rowNames defined in this transactionManager will be considered safe.
    Otherwise the newest initialized transaction manager will determine what components are safe and/or unsafe like
    the current behavior.'

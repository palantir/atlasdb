  description: The AtlasBackupService will now verify the consistency of backups by
    checking state of the internal CoordinationService. AtlasDB will also manage the storage of all data necessary
    to restore from the backup.
    This will simplify the process of safely taking a backup of an AtlasDB namespace, as well as making it more
    resilient to any future AtlasDB changes.

fix:
  description: Users of embedded or leader block services now attempt to explicitly
    unlock a successfully acquired immutable timestamp lock if a subsequent call to
    the timestamp or lock services fails. Previously this could lead to the immutable
    timestamp being suppressed for long periods of time, meaning that sweep and/or
    hard deletes would be stuck.

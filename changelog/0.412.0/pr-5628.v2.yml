  description: AtlasDB sweeper service (``/sweep``) now exposes a new endpoint (``sweep-previously-conservative-now-thorough-table``)
    that can be used to safely sweep tables that were previously used with conservative
    sweep and now use thorough sweep, by intentionally leaving a small fraction of
    the data. This was previously not safe, as sweeping away too many consecutive
    legacy sentinels can cause range scan failures in Cassandra. Once compactions
    have been completed, it should be safe to run an iteration of full sweep to remove
    all the left over sweepable values.

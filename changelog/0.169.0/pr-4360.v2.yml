fix:
  description: '`FastFailoverProxy` now correctly identifies retryable exceptions
    and deals with them. Previously, the proxy would expect a _shaded_ retryable exception,
    when the exceptions it received would have been unshaded as they would have originated
    from TimeLock and thus external to the `atlasdb-feign` client project.'

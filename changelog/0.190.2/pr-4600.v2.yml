fix:
  description: KeyValueServiceRuntimeConfig added to the list of Jackson discoverable
    classes for successful serialization/deserialization of/to AtlasDbRuntimeConfig.
    Previously, key value service runtime configuration would not have been deserializable,
    meaning that attempting to define runtime configuration in YML would cause an
    exception to be thrown.

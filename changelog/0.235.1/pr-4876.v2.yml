fix:
  description: We now no longer use exactly the same metric name for the tagged and
    legacy invocation handlers. Previously, these used the same metric name, meaning
    that which metric was logged was non-deterministic, and furthermore once an error
    occurred once each on *both* a tagged and legacy-instrumented object, getting
    metrics from AtlasDB would cause an error.

  description: 'AtlasDB no longer publishes `transactionsReadFromDB`: it was a high
    cardinality metric of limited value. Consider using `TransactionService.get` if
    attempting to determine the total number of start-commit timestamp mappings looked
    up from the transactions tables. Otherwise, consider enabling TRACE logging to
    get this data.'

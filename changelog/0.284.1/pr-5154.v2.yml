  description: 'TransactionLockAcquisitionTimeoutExceptions are now retryable. The
    main implications of this are that clients will attempt to retry when lock acquisition
    times out, which typically happens due to a leader election. However, this also
    means that requests will retry in cases where lock acquisition timing out is a
    non-transient issue. '

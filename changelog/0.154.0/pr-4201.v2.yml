  description: |-
    Stream store metadata cleanup tasks now clear up streams that are stored if they have zero entries in the index table. Previously, if a service crashed between storing a stream non-transactionally and marking it (or otherwise chose not to mark the stream as used), the stream data for the unmarked stream would never be cleared from the database.

    Note that this change does not apply retroactively to streams that were already leaked as described above.

    Users who have checked in the generated AtlasDB schema code will need to regenerate their schemas once they are on this version of AtlasDB. Users that re-generate this via buildscripts do not need to perform any manual tasks.

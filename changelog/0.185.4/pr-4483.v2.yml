  description: "Ability to make persister reusable (through specifying the @Reusable annotation) and not to create a new
    instance on each hydration. Schemas must be regenerated in order to enable this.

    Note: Persisters are only reusable if they're thread-safe and stateless.

    The default behaviour is to create a new instance of persister on each hydration to avoid issues with persisters
    which are stateful."

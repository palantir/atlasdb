  description: Fixed a memory leak that occurred where cleanup tasks from failed transactions
    maintained a reference to the transaction (as opposed to just the information
    needed for the cleanup task), preventing them from being garbage collected. This
    is significant as writes and, in the case of serializable transactions, reads,
    are retained in the transaction objects.

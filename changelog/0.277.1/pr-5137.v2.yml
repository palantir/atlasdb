fix:
  description: '`getRowsColumnRange` and `getRowsColumnRangeIterator` now return a
    single iterator for a given row. Previously, users could obtain multiple distinct
    views wrapping an underlying iterator, which can lead to misleading or incorrect
    results e.g. because iterators may pre-load some of their elements.'

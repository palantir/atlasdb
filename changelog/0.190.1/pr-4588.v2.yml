    To avoid very large reads on Cassandra, the getRows endpoint now splits a read query into number of serial requests with limited reads instead of fetching all the cells (all the versions) for a given list of rows from Cassandra. It is maintained that all the cells are read and only (some) older versions of cells may be skipped while reading from Cassandra.
    
    The read limit per request is configurable.

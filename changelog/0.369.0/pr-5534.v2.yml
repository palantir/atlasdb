fix:
  description: Publishing of AtlasDB dependent services should work again; this was
    broken because of what the maintainers believe to be a bad interaction between
    dependency-control and check implicit dependencies. This reverts the offending
    dependency and disables the check which is believed to be erroneously firing.
    We seek to re-enable the implicit dependency check soon.

fix:
  description: We've fixed at least one known source of durable writes violations.
    Specifically, the issue is that a MaybeWitnessedTransaction is currently filtered
    out if it has not definitively committed. However, that is not a guarantee that
    it won't subsequently commit if e.g. cassandra is slow and it told the worker
    thread that it failed, but it actually did not. Future AtlasDB readers will normally
    force the question of whether a given value committed or was definitely aborted
    before returning, but the workload server generally did not do this.

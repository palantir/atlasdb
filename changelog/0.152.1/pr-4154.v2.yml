improvement:
  description: We no longer run Background Sweep by default if Targeted Sweep is fully
    enabled (that is, writes to the sweep queue and reading from the sweep queue are
    both enabled). Background Sweep may still be enabled in this case by explicitly
    setting `sweep#enabled` to true in runtime configuration.

    Added gzip compression support to the stream store. To use specify ``.compressStreamInClient(StreamCompression.GZIP)`` on your StreamStoreDefinitionBuilder in your schema.
    The following limitations must be considered when using or changing compression on a pre-existing stream store:
    - You cannot add any form of compression to a stream store that is currently not compressed
    - You can freely switch between compression types of stream stores that are already compressed

  description: |-
    Targeted sweep runtime configuration now has an `enableAutoTuning` parameter. While true, targeted sweep will dynamically adjust the pause between sweep iterations based on the amount of work that was done. It will, furthermore, attempt to read a full batch (100k) of entries to sweep whenever possible. This feature is still experimental and disabled by default. Please contact the AtlasDB team if you wish to use it.

    The `batchShardIterations` parameter has been removed and if it is specified it will be ignored, use `maximumPartitionsToBatchInSingleRead` or `enableAutoTuning` instead.

improvement:
  description: We now create the NoOpLockWatchManager from an already-defined Event
    Cache, as opposed to creating it with a fresh (and different!) cache. Previously
    there were 2 event caches when using no-op, one which updates were read from and
    _another one_ where responses from timelock were processed.

fix:
  description: The methods `getRowsColumnRange()` (both 3-argument and 4-argument
    signatures) and `getRowsColumnRangeIterator()` now correctly account for local
    writes in cases where a row does not exist in the KVS. Previously these local
    writes would simply be ignored and not returned in the output.

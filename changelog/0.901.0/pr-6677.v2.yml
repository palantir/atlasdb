  description: "Reuse notLatestVisibleValueCellFilterCounter \n\nAvoid expensive metric
    name computation for each value extraction by\nregistering the notLatestVisibleValueCellFilterCounter
    once and reusing\nit throughout the lifetime.\n\nNote that this includes several
    internal API changes; however, these\nshould not be an issue for any known AtlasDB
    consumers.\n\nCellLoader.loadWithTs minimizes unobserved tracing overhead"

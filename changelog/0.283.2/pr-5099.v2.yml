  description: Targeted sweep now has a runtime configuration `batchCellThreshold`
    that allows specifying a batch size lower than the previous default of 100k. This
    may be useful to make sweep iterations faster and more uniform at the expense
    of slightly slower progress. The new default has also been reduced to 10k.

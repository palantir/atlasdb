/**
 * An extension of KeyValueService that allows for auto-expiring data.
 * The anticipated usage is allowing easy and highly available persistence of data structures like caches and queues,
 * which perform exceptionally poorly if implemented only through KeyValueService.
 *
 * Contract with the user:
 * - This is for space and deletion time savings only.
 * - This does not fulfill the same goals/legal requirements as hard delete for sensitive data. (though data written by this service can itself be deleted by normal hard delete routines)
 * - // todo Only tables marked with 'AllowsSelfExpiringData' in their schema may use these features
 *
 * - Normal atlas guarantees may be broken. Data written with expiration times are:
 * 1. not guaranteed to expire atomically with the entire row or at any other level of granularity
 * 2. not guaranteed to exist at any time after being written (as this feature implicitly requires distributed wall clock time)
 * 3. not guaranteed to be deleted after the specified expiration time
 *
 * That said, points #2 and #3 are attempted on a best-effort basis and should work adequately with synchronized cluster clocks and expiration durations generously outside what is strictly necessary for the application.

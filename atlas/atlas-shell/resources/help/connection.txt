CONNECTION OBJECTS
------------------

    class Connection
     Class that manages the connection to the underlying database. There
     are 4 static methods to create various flavors of connection.

        Connection.snapshot_in_memory
         connect to an empty in-memory database handling snapshot transactions

        Connection.readonly_in_memory
         connect to an empty in-memory database handling only readonly transactions

        Connection.snapshot_from_dispatch host, port, user, pass
         connect to real database handling snapshot transactions through dispatch

        Connection.readonly_from_db host, port, sid, type, username, password
         connect to real database handling only readonly transactions directly

        connection.table_names
         get all table names in the schema

        connection.table table_name (returns Table)
         retrieve a table object by name

        connection.run &block (passes Transaction to block)
         run the given block as a snapshot transaction, with retry
         e.g. connection.run {|tx| tx.get_row(...)}

        connection.try &block (passes Transaction to block)
         run the given block as a snapshot transaction, without retry
         e.g. connection.try {|tx| tx.get_row(...)}

        connection.read &block (passes Transaction to block)
         run the given block as a readonly transaction, without retry
         e.g. connection.read {|tx| tx.get_row(...)}

        connection.unsafe (returns Transaction)
         return a bare Transaction object directly (be careful!)
         e.g. connection.read {|tx| tx.get_row(...)}

CONVENIENCE GLOBAL VARIABLES
----------------------------

    There is also a convenience method connect() that you can use like so.
    It sets up global variables: $db to hold the Connection object, and
    one $<TABLE_NAME> for each table name to hold the Table object.

    You can use it like so:

      connect(:type=>"ORACLE", :host=>"my_db_host", :port=>"1521", :sid=>"my_sid",
              :username=>"my_username", :password=>"my_password")
      $obj_fragment.view             # view the obj_fragment table
      $db.table('obj_fragment').view # same thing

    or to connect through dispatch

      connect(:type=>"DISPATCH", :host=>"my_dispatch_host", :port=>"3280",
              :username=>"pg_username", :password=>"pg_password")

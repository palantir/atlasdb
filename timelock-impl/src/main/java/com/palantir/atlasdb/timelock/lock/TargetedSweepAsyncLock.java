            - on error
            - or explicitly called

        This will also complete the next lock request if any, which can block depending on the rate limit.

        Since locks are asynchronously unlocked and the unlocks are batched together, you end up getting head of line
        blocking for any non-targeted sweep locks batched together with a targeted sweep locks to be unlocked.

        Given a batch of LockTokens you would have to hope that the targeted sweep locks are processed last, but that's
        not a given, and we can't control it from the client otherwise we'd have fixed the bug in the first place.

        If we get an unlock request for a targeted sweep lock, we should then process this asynchronously so that this
        method returns quickly. We don't care so much about holding to the targeted sweep lock for a fraction longer,
        as we are trying to rate limit it anyway!

        Targeted sweep requests a lock with acquire timeout of 100ms.

        So whilst it's all well and good to rate limit the lock, we want to hold onto any requests that successfully
        acquire the lock and add an artificial delay. In doing so, it means they can't request another lock 50ms later,
        thus reducing the rate of requests on timelock.

        Targeted sweep has an acquire timeout of 100ms, so if we've acquired the lock, but not the rate limit permit, we
        don't want to timeout the request as that would mean 50ms later we try again and we'll never get the lock. So we
        just extend any timeout by a second.

        If a lock is legitimately held, and *another* request wants to acquire it, then the new request will wait up to
        a second. This is fine, because it means that the request doesn't time out after 100ms and try again in 50ms, so
        this also reduces the rate of requests on timelock.

        This is synchronized => you can only timeout a request if the lock is either held or not held, not whilst
        acquiring the lock for the next request in the queue.

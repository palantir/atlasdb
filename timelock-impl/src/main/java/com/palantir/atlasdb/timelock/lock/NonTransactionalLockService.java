 * This lock service may be used as a LockService, for the purposes of advisory locking as well as for
 * users to take locks outside of the transaction protocol.
 *
 * However, it does NOT allow transactions to take place, as it throws on attempts to acquire the immutable timestamp.
 * We rely on the previous implementation of SnapshotTransactionManager#getImmutableTimestampInternal (e.g. in 0.48.0),
 * which attempts to acquire the immutable timestamp before transactions begin running.

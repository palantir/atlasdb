/**
 * Releases lock tokens from a {@link TimelockService} asynchronously.
 *
 * There is another layer of retrying below us (at the HTTP client level) for external timelock users.
 * Also, in the event we fail to unlock (e.g. because of a connection issue), locks will eventually time-out.
 * Thus not retrying is reasonably safe (as long as we can guarantee that the lock won't otherwise be refreshed).
 *
 * Concurrency: We want to guarantee that a token T that is enqueued is included in some call to unlockOutstanding.
 * If T can pass the compareAndSet, then T itself is scheduled. If T does not, that means there is some other
 * thread that has scheduled the task, but the task has not retrieved the reference to the set of tokens to be
 * unlocked (because it re-sets unlockIsScheduled to false first, before extracting the reference to the set).
